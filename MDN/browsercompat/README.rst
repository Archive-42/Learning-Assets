The Browser Compatibility API was a project to support compatibility data on
the `Mozilla Developer Network`_.  This currently takes the form of browser
compatibility tables, such as the one on the `CSS display property`_ page.  The
API would centralize this data, and allow it to be kept consistent across
languages and presentations.

.. _CSS display property: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#Browser_compatibility

The project started in December 2013.  The initial goals and requirements are
documented on the MozillaWiki_.

Status
------
This project has been cancelled.  The have been no code changes since March
2016. In April 2017, we started the process of removing integration from MDN
and decommisioning the API server.  See the `issues page`_ for the status
as of March 2016.

As of 2017, these are the current MDN data projects:

* https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data
