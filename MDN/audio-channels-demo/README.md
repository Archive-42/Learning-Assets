===================

The currently-Firefox OS-only [AudioChannels API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/B2G_OS/API/Audio_Channels_API) allows you to specify the position your audio occupies in a hierarchy of importance. Going forward, less important audio items and events will not pause your audio playing, but more important ones will. For example, you will want your audio player app to continue playing in the background while you do other things, but you will want to mute it while you answer a phone call.
