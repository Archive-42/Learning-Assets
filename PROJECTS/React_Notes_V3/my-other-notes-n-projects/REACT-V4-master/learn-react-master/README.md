Learn React.js for *high performance* JavaScript applications.

## Start

- Getting started: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html
(recommends using [JSX](http://jsx.github.io) which is quite bleeding-edge)
- Tutorial: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html


## Background

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

+ **Just the UI:** Lots of people use React as the V in MVC.
Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack,
it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.
+ **Virtual DOM:** React uses a *virtual DOM* diff implementation
for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server using
Node.js â€” no heavy browser DOM required.
  * This means that every time something changes, React creates a _virtual_ DOM tree, checks for the differences between that and the existing DOM and then re-renders **only the differences** to the DOM
+ **Data flow:** React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces
boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
