# Cryptocurrencies

I think [Nano](nano.md) is the future of money if compared to any other coin based off its features. Whilst [Ethereum](../databases/blockchain/ethereum.md)/[Tezos](../databases/blockchain/tezos.md) are great for building out more complex decentralized apps.

It's a matter of time that [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md) with its horrible PoW consensus that [wastes electricity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0HC1Udk6-E) and its slow & expensive transactions will no longer be used (even as a store of value).

## Notes

- [The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. What actually matters is making goods & providing services. We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint. Whichever has least error & latency will win.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704)
