You can access your current folder from your WSL instance by running the following command:

```bash
powershell.exe /c start .
 ```

You will need to be on Windows 10 version 1903 or higher to access this feature. Check out [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-for-wsl-in-windows-10-version-1903/) for more info.
