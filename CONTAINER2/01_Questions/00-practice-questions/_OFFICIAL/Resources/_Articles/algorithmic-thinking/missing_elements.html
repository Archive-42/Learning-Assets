  <h1 id="how-to-find-missing-elements">How to Find Missing Elements</h1>
  <p></p>
  <p>I have written several articles about mind twisters. Today, let’s look at another interesting question.</p>
  <p>The question is simple:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/missing_elements/title_en.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Given an arry of length n, the index should be in <code>[0, n)</code>. Since we have to put <code>n+1</code> number
    of elements from set <code>[0, n]</code>, there must be one element which can’t fit. Find the missing element.</p>
  <p>This question is not hard. It’s easy to think aabout traversing after sorting. Alternatively, using a
    <code>HashSet</code> to store all the existing elements, and then go through elements in <code>[0, n]</code> and
    loop up in the <code>HashSet</code>. Both ways can find the correct answer.
  </p>
  <p>However, the time complexity for the sorting solution is O(NlogN). The <code>HashSet</code> solution has O(N) for
    time complexity, but requires O(N) space complexity to store the data.</p>
  <p><strong>Third Solution: Bit Operation</strong></p>
  <p>The XOR operation (<code>^</code>) has a special property: the result of a number XOR itself is 0, and the result
    of a number with 0 is itself.</p>
  <p>In addition, XOR operation satisfies the Exchange Law and Communicative Law. For instance:</p>
  <p>2 ^ 3 ^ 2 = 3 ^ (2 ^ 2) = 3 ^ 0 = 3</p>
  <p>We can using these special properties to find the missing element through a smart way. For example,
    <code>nums = [0,3,1,4]</code>：
  </p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/missing_elements/1.jpg" /></p>
  <p>For easier understanding, let’s assume the index increments by 1 (from <code>[0, n)</code> to <code>[0, n]</code>),
    and let each element to be placed at the index of its value:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/missing_elements/2.jpg" /></p>
  <p>After doing so, all elements and their indices will be a pair except the missing element. If we can find out index
    2 is missing, we can find out the missing element subsequently.</p>
  <p>How to find out the missing number? <strong>Perform XOR operations to all elements and their indices respectively.
      A pair of an element and its index will become 0. Only the missing element will be left.</strong></p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1"><span>int</span> <span>missingNumber</span>(<span>int</span>[] nums)
    {</a>
    <a title="2"> <span>int</span> n = nums.<span>length</span>;</a>
    <a title="3"> <span>int</span> res = <span>0</span>;</a>
    <a title="4"> <span>// XOR with the new index first</span></a>
    <a title="5"> res ^= n;</a>
    <a id=-6" title="6"> <span>// XOR with the all elements and the other indices</span></a>
    <a title="7"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; n; i++)</a>
    <a title="8"> res ^= i ^ nums[i];</a>
    <a title="9"> <span>return</span> res;</a>
    <a id=-10" title="10">}</a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p><img src="./pictures/missing_elements/3.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Because XOR operation fulfills the Exchange Law and the Communicative Law, all pairs of numbers will become 0, left
      with the missing element.</p>
    <p>Till now, the time complexity is O(N), and the space complexity is O(1). This is optimal. <em>Should we stop
        now?</em></p>
    <p>If we think so, we have become restricted by algorithms. The more knowledge we learn, the easier we might fall into
      stagnant mindsets. There is actually an even easier solution: <strong>Summation of Arithmetic Progression
        (AP)</strong>.</p>
    <p>We can interpret the question in this way: given an arithmetic progression <code>0, 1, 2, ..., n</code> with an
      missing element, please find out the missing one. Consequently, the number is just
      <code>sum(0,1,..n) - sum(nums)</code>!
    </p>
    <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1"><span>int</span> <span>missingNumber</span>(<span>int</span>[] nums)
    {</a>
    <a id=-2" title="2"> <span>int</span> n = nums.<span>length</span>;</a>
    <a id=-3" title="3"> <span>// Formula: (head + tail) * n / 2</span></a>
    <a id=-4" title="4"> <span>int</span> expect = (<span>0</span> + n) * (n + <span>1</span>) / <span>2</span>;</a>
    <a id=-5" title="5"></a>
    <a id=-6" title="6"> <span>int</span> sum = <span>0</span>;</a>
    <a id=-7" title="7"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> x : nums) </a>
    <a id=-8" title="8"> sum += x;</a>
    <a id=-9" title="9"> <span>return</span> expect - sum;</a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>As you can see, this is the simplest solution. But honestly, even I didn’t think of this way. It may be hard for an
      experienced programmers to think in this way, but very easy for a secondary school student to come up with such a
      solution.</p>
  <p><em>Should we stop now?</em></p>
  <p>If we think so, we might still need to pay more attention to details. When we use the formula to calculate
    <code>except</code>, have you thought about <strong>Integer overflow</strong>? If the product is too big and
    overflowing, the final result must be wrong.
  </p>
  <p>In the previous implementation, we subtract two sums. To avoid overflow, why not perform subtraction while summing
    up? Similar to our bit operation solution just now, assume <code>nums = [0,3,1,4]</code>, add an index such that
    elements will be paired up with indices respectively.</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/missing_elements/xor.png" /></p>
  <p>Let’s subtract each element from its corresponding index, and then sum up the differences, the result will be the
    missing element!</p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1"><span>public</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>missingNumber</span>(<span>int</span>[] nums) {</a>
    <a title="2"> <span>int</span> n = nums.<span>length</span>;</a>
    <a title="3"> <span>int</span> res = <span>0</span>;</a>
    <a id=-4" title="4"> <span>// Added index</span></a>
    <a id=-5" title="5"> res += n - <span>0</span>;</a>
    <a id=-6" title="6"> <span>// Summing up the differences between the remaining indices and elements</span></a>
    <a id=-7" title="7"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; n; i++) </a>
    <a id=-8" title="8"> res += i - nums[i];</a>
    <a id=-9" title="9"> <span>return</span> res;</a>
    <a id=-10" title="10">}</a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>Because both addition and subtraction satisfy the Exchange Law and the Communicative Law, we can always eliminate
      paired numbers, left with the missing one.</p>
  <p><em>We can stop by now.</em></p>
