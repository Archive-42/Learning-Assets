  <h1 id="kmp-character-matching-algorithm-in-dynamic-programming">KMP Character Matching Algorithm in Dynamic
    Programming</h1>
  <p><strong>Translator: <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/ExcaliburEX">ExcaliburEX</a></strong></p>
  <p>The KMP algorithm (Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm) is a well-known string matching algorithm. It is very efficient,
    but it is a bit complicated.</p>
  <p>Many readers complain that the KMP algorithm is incomprehensible. This is normal. When I think about the KMP
    algorithm explained in university textbooks, I don’t know how many future Knuth, Morris, Pratt will be dismissed in
    advance. Some excellent students use the process of pushing the KMP algorithm to help understand the algorithm. This
    is a way, but this article will help the reader understand the principle of the algorithm from a logical level.
    Between ten lines of code, KMP died.</p>
  <p><strong>First of all, at the beginning, this article uses <code>pat</code> to represent the pattern string, the
      length is <code>M</code>, <code>txt</code> represents the text string, and the length is <code>N</code>. The KMP
      algorithm is to find the substring <code>pat</code> in <code>txt</code>. If it exists, it returns the starting
      index of this substring, otherwise it returns -1</strong>.</p>
  <p>Why I think the KMP algorithm is a dynamic programming problem, I will explain it later. For dynamic programming,
    it has been emphasized many times that the meaning of the <code>dp</code> array must be clear, and the same problem
    may have more than one way to define the meaning of the <code>dp</code> array. Different definitions have different
    solutions.</p>
  <p>The KMP algorithm that readers have seen is that a wave of weird operations processes <code>pat</code> to form a
    one-dimensional array <code>next</code>, and then passes through another wave of complex operations to match
    <code>txt</code>. Time complexity O (N), space complexity O (M). In fact, its <code>next</code> array is equivalent
    to <code>dp</code> array, and the meaning of the elements is related to the prefix and suffix of <code>pat</code>.
    The decision rules are complicated and difficult to understand.<strong>This article uses a two-dimensional
      <code>dp</code> array (but the space complexity is still O (M)) to redefine the meaning of the elements, which
      greatly reduces the code length and greatly improves the interpretability</strong>。
  </p>
  <p>PS： The code of this article refers to “Algorithm 4”. The name of the array used in the original code is
    <code>DFA</code> (Determining the Finite State Machine). Because our public account has a series of dynamic
    programming articles before, it will not say such a tall noun. Made a little modification to the code in the book
    and inherited the name of the <code>dp</code> array.
  </p>
  <h3 id="i.-overview-of-kmp-algorithm">I. Overview of KMP Algorithm</h3>
  <p>First, let’s briefly introduce the differences between the KMP algorithm and the brute-force algorithm, the
    difficulties, and the relationship with dynamic programming.</p>
  <p>The brute-force string matching algorithm is easy to write. Take a look at its logic:</p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1"><span>// Brute-force matching (pseudo-code)</span></a>
    <a title="2"><span>int</span> <span>search</span>(<span>String</span> pat, <span>String</span> txt) {</a>

    <a title="3"> <span>int</span> M = pat.<span>length</span>;</a>
    <a title="4"> <span>int</span> N = txt.<span>length</span>;</a>
    <a title="5"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt;= N - M; i++) {</a>
    <a id=-6" title="6"> <span>int</span> j;</a>
    <a title="7"> <span>for</span> (j = <span>0</span>; j &lt; M; j++) {</a>
    <a title="8"> <span>if</span> (pat[j] != txt[i+j])</a>
    <a title="9"> <span>break</span>;</a>
    <a id=-10" title="10"> }</a>
    <a title="11"> <span>// pat all matches</span></a>
    <a id=-12" title="12"> <span>if</span> (j == M) <span>return</span> i;</a>
    <a id=-13" title="13"> }</a>
    <a id=-14" title="14"> <span>// pat substring does not exist in txt</span></a>
    <a id=-15" title="15"> <span>return</span> -<span>1</span>;</a>
    <a id=-16" title="16">}</a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>For brute force algorithms, if there are mismatched characters, both pointers of <code>txt</code> and
    <code>pat</code> are rolled back, nested for loops, time complexity <span><em>O</em>(<em>M</em><em>N</em>)</span>,
    space complexity <span><em>O</em>(1)</span>. The main problem is that if there are many repeated characters in the
    string, the algorithm seems stupid.
  </p>
  <p>such as txt = “aaacaaab” pat = “aaab”：</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./pictures/kmp/1.gif" alt="brutal" />
    <figcaption>brutal</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Obviously, there is no character c in <code>pat</code> at all, and it is not necessary to roll back the pointer
    <code>i</code>. The brute force solution obviously does a lot of unnecessary operations.
  </p>
  <p>The KMP algorithm is different in that it takes space to record some information, which makes it smart in the above
    cases:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./pictures/kmp/2.gif" alt="kmp1" />
    <figcaption>kmp1</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Another example is similar txt = “aaaaaaab” pat = “aaab”. The brute force solution will go back to the pointer
    <code>i</code> as stupidly as the above example, and the KMP algorithm will be clever:
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="./pictures/kmp/3.gif" alt="kmp2" />
    <figcaption>kmp2</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Because the KMP algorithm knows that the character a before the character b is matched, it is only necessary to
    compare whether the character b is matched every time.</p>
  <p><strong>The KMP algorithm never rolls back the pointer <code>i</code> of <code>txt</code> and does not go back (it
      does not scan <code>txt</code> repeatedly), but uses the information stored in the <code>dp</code> array to move
      <code>pat</code> to the correct position to continue matching</strong>. The time complexity only needs O(N), and
    space is used for time, so I think it is a dynamic programming algorithm.</p>
  <p>The difficulty of the KMP algorithm is how to calculate the information in the <code>dp</code> array? How to move
    the pointer of pat correctly based on this information? This requires <strong>Determining Finite State
      Automata</strong> to assist. Don’t be afraid of such a large literary vocabulary. In fact, it is exactly the same
    as the dynamic programming <code>dp</code> array. You can use this word to scare others when you learn it.</p>
  <p>One more thing to be clear about: <strong>Calculate the <code>dp</code> array, only related to the <code>pat</code>
      string</strong>. It means that as long as you give me a <code>pat</code>, I can calculate the<code>dp</code> array
    from this pattern string, and then you can give me different <code>txt</code>, I am not afraid, I can use this
    <code>dp</code> array. String matching is done at O ​​(N) time.
  </p>
  <p>Specifically, for example, the two examples mentioned above:</p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1">txt1 <span>=</span> <span>&quot;aaacaaab&quot;</span> </a>
    <a id=-2" title="2">pat <span>=</span> <span>&quot;aaab&quot;</span></a>
    <a id=-3" title="3">txt2 <span>=</span> <span>&quot;aaaaaaab&quot;</span> </a>
    <a id=-4" title="4">pat <span>=</span> <span>&quot;aaab&quot;</span></a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>Our <code>txt</code> is different, but <code>pat</code> is the same, so the <code>dp</code> array used by the KMP
    algorithm is the same.</p>
  <p>Just for the upcoming unmatched case of <code>txt1</code>:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/txt1.jpg" /></p>
  <p>The <code>dp</code> array instructs <code>pat</code> to move like this:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/txt2.jpg" /></p>
  <p>PS：This <code>j</code> should not be interpreted as an index, its meaning should be more accurately
    <strong>state</strong>, so it will appear in this strange position, which will be described later.
  </p>
  <p>And for the following unmatched case of <code>txt2</code>:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/txt3.jpg" /></p>
  <p>The <code>dp</code> array instructs <code>pat</code> to move like this:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/txt4.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Understand that the <code>dp</code> array is only related to <code>pat</code>, so we will design the KMP algorithm
    more beautifully:</p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1"><span>public</span> <span>class</span> KMP {</a>
          <a title="2"> <span>private</span> <span>int</span>[][] dp;</a>
    <a title="3"> <span>private</span> <span>String</span> pat;</a>
    <a id=-4" title="4"></a>
    <a id=-5" title="5"> <span>public</span> <span>KMP</span>(<span pan> pat) {</a>
    <a id=-6" title="6"> <span>this</span>.<span>pat</span> = pat;</a>
    <a id=-7" title="7"> <span>// Build dp array from pat</span></a>
    <a id=-8" title="8"> <span>// Requires O (M) time</span></a>
    <a id=-9" title="9"> }</a>
    <a id=-10" title="10"></a>
    <a id=-11" title="11"> <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>search</span>(<span pan> txt) {</a> <a id=-12"
      title="12"> <span>// Match txt with dp array</span></a>
    <a id=-13" title="13"> <span>// O (N) time required</span></a>
    <a id=-14" title="14"> }</a>
    <a id=-15" title="15">}</a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>In this way, when we need to use the same <code>pat</code> to match different <code>txt</code>, we don’t need to
    waste time constructing <code>dp</code> arrays:</p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code
            ><a   title=" 1">KMP kmp = <span>new</span> <span>KMP</span>(<span>&quot;aaab&quot;</span>);</a>
    <a id=-2" title="2"><span>int</span> pos1 = kmp.<span>search</span>(<span>&quot;aaacaaab&quot;</span>);
      <span>//4</span></a>
    <a id=-3" title="3"><span>int</span> pos2 = kmp.<span>search</span>(<span>&quot;aaaaaaab&quot;</span>);
      <span>//4</span></a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <h3 id="overview-of-state-machines">Overview of State Machines</h3>
  <p>Why is the KMP algorithm related to the state machine? That’s it, we can think of a <code>pat</code> match as a
    state transition. For example when pat = “ABABC”:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/state.jpg" /></p>
  <p>As shown above, the number in the circle is the state, state 0 is the starting state, and state 5
    (<code>pat.length</code>) is the ending state. At the beginning of the match, <code>pat</code> is in the starting
    state. Once it is transferred to the ending state, it means that <code>pat</code> was found in <code>txt</code>. For
    example, if it is currently in state 2, the character “AB” is matched:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/state2.jpg" /></p>
  <p>In addition, <code>pat</code> state transition behaves differently in different states. For example, suppose that
    it now matches state 4. If it encounters character A, it should transition to state 3, if it encounters character C,
    it should transition to state 5, and if it encounters character B, it should transition to state 0:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/state4.jpg" /></p>
  <p>What does it mean, let’s take a look at each example. Use the variable <code>j</code> to indicate a pointer to the
    current state. The current <code>pat</code> matches state 4:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/exp1.jpg" /></p>
  <p>If the character “A” is encountered, it is the smartest to transition to state 3 as indicated by the arrow:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/exp3.jpg" /></p>
  <p>If the character “B” is encountered, as indicated by the arrow, it can only be transferred to state 0 (returning to
    liberation overnight):</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/exp5.jpg" /></p>
  <p>If the character “C” is encountered, it should transition to the termination state 5 according to the arrow, which
    means that the match is complete:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/exp7.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Of course, you may also encounter other characters, such as Z, but you should obviously move to the starting state
    0, because there is no character Z at all in <code>pat</code>:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/z.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Here for clarity, when we draw the state diagram, the arrows that transfer other characters to state 0 are omitted,
    and only the state transition of the characters appearing in <code>pat</code> is drawn:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/allstate.jpg" /></p>
  <p>The most critical step of the KMP algorithm is to construct this state transition diagram. <strong>To determine the
      behavior of the state transition, two variables must be specified, one is the current matching state and the other
      is the character encountered</strong>; Once these two variables are determined, you can know which one to transfer
    in this case status.</p>
  <p>Let’s take a look at the process of the KMP algorithm matching the string <code>txt</code> according to this state
    transition diagram:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/kmp.gif" /></p>
  <p><strong>Remember this GIF matching process, this is the core logic of the KMP algorithm</strong>！</p>
  <p>To describe the state transition diagram, we define a two-dimensional dp array, which has the following meaning:
  </p>
  <div>
    pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title="1">dp[j][c] <span >=</span> <span >next</span></a>
  <a  id=-2" title="2"><span >0</span> <span >&lt;=</span> j <span >&lt;</span> M，The current state of the table</a>
  <a  id=-3" title="3"><span >0</span> <span >&lt;=</span> c <span >&lt;</span> 256，Character encountered (ASCII code)</a>
  <a id=-4" title="4"><span>0</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>next</span> <span>&lt;=</span> M，Represents the
    <span>next</span> state</a>
  <a  id=-5" title="5"></a>
  <a  id=-6" title="6">dp[<span >4</span>][<span >&#39;A&#39;</span>] <span >=</span> <span >3</span> Means: </a>
  <a  id=-7" title="7">The current state <span >is</span> <span >4</span>, <span >if</span> the character A <span >is</span> encountered, </a>
  <a  id=-8" title="8">pat should go to state <span >3</span></a>
  <a  id=-9" title="9"></a>
  <a  id=-10" title="10">dp[<span >1</span>][<span >&#39;B&#39;</span>] <span >=</span> <span >2</span> Means:</a>
  <a  id=-11" title="11">Current state <span >1</span>, <span >if</span> character B <span >is</span> encountered,</a>
  <a  id=-12" title="12">pat should transition to state <span >2</span></a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>According to the definition of our dp array and the process of state transition just now, we can first write the
    search function code of the KMP algorithm:</p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1"><span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>search</span>(<span>String</span>
          txt)
    {</a>
    <a id=-2" title="2"> <span>int</span> M = pat.<span>length</span>();</a>
    <a id=-3" title="3"> <span>int</span> N = txt.<span>length</span>();</a>
    <a id=-4" title="4"> <span>// The initial state of pat is 0</span></a>
    <a id=-5" title="5"> <span>int</span> j = <span>0</span>;</a>
    <a id=-6" title="6"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; N; i++) {</a>
    <a id=-7" title="7"> <span>// The current state is j. The character txt [i] is encountered.</span></a>
    <a id=-8" title="8"> <span>// Which state should pat go to?</span></a>
    <a id=-9" title="9"> j = dp[j][txt.<span>charAt</span>(i)];</a>
    <a id=-10" title="10"> <span>// If the termination state is reached, the index at the beginning of the match is
        returned</span></a>
    <a id=-11" title="11"> <span>if</span> (j == M) <span>return</span> i - M + <span>1</span>;</a>
    <a id=-12" title="12"> }</a>
    <a id=-13" title="13"> <span>// Not reached termination state, matching failed</span></a>
    <a id=-14" title="14"> <span>return</span> -<span>1</span>;</a>
    <a id=-15" title="15">}</a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>At this point, it should still be well understood. The <code>dp</code> array is the state transition diagram we
    just drew. If not clear, go back and see the evolution of the GIF algorithm. Here’s how to build this
    <code>dp</code> array via <code>pat</code>?
  </p>
  <h3 id="iii.-building-a-state-transition-diagram">III. Building a state transition diagram</h3>
  <p>Recall what just said:<strong>To determine the behavior of state transitions, two variables must be specified, one
      is the current matching state and the other is the character encountered</strong>, And we have determined the
    meaning of the <code>dp</code> array according to this logic, then the framework for constructing the
    <code>dp</code> array is like this:
  </p>
  <div id="cb7">
    pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title="1"><span >for</span> <span >0</span> <span >&lt;=</span> j <span >&lt;</span> M: <span ># status</span></a>
  <a  id="cb7-2" title="2">    <span >for</span> <span >0</span> <span >&lt;=</span> c <span >&lt;</span> <span >256</span>: <span ># character</span></a>
  <a id="cb7-3" title="3"> dp[j][c] <span>=</span> <span>next</span></a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>How should we find this next state? Obviously, <strong>If the characters <code>c</code> and <code>pat[j]</code>
      match</strong>, the state should move forward by one. That is, <code>next = j + 1</code>. We might as well call
    this situation <strong>state advance</strong>:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/forward.jpg" /></p>
  <p>If the characters <code>c</code> and <code>pat[j]</code> do not match, the state will roll back (or stay in place),
    we might as well call this situation <strong>state restart</strong>:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/back.jpg" /></p>
  <p>So, how do you know in which state to restart? Before answering this question, we define another name:
    <strong>Shadow State</strong> (i named), which is represented by the variable <code>X</code>. <strong>The so-called
      shadow state has the same prefix as the current state</strong>. For example:
  </p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/shadow.jpg" /></p>
  <p>The current state <code>j = 4</code>, its shadow state is <code>X = 2</code>, and they all have the same prefix
    “AB”. Because the state <code>X</code> and the state <code>j</code> have the same prefix, when the state
    <code>j</code> is ready for state restart (the characters encountered <code>c</code> and <code>pat[j]</code> do not
    match), you can use <code>X</code> State transition diagram to get <strong>recent restart position</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>For example, if the state <code>j</code> encountered a character “A”, where should it go? First of all, the state
    can only be advanced if it encounters “C”. Obviously, it can only restart the state when it encounters “A”.
    <strong>State <code>j</code> will delegate this character to state <code>X</code> processing, which is
      <code>dp[j]['A'] = dp[X]['A']</code></strong>:
  </p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/shadow1.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Why is this possible? Because: Since <code>j</code> has been determined that the character “A” cannot be advanced,
    <strong>can only be rolled back</strong>, and KMP wants to <strong>roll back as little as possible</strong> to avoid
    unnecessary calculations. Then <code>j</code> can ask <code>X</code> with the same prefix as itself. If
    <code>X</code> meets “A” and can perform “state advancement”, then it will be transferred, because it will have the
    least rollback.
  </p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/A.gif" /></p>
  <p>Of course, if the character encountered is “B”, the state <code>X</code> cannot be “state advanced” and can only be
    rolled back. <code>j</code> just needs to roll back in the direction of <code>X</code>:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/shadow2.jpg" /></p>
  <p>You may ask, how does this <code>X</code> know that when it encounters the character “B”, it will fall back to
    state 0? Because <code>X</code> always follows behind <code>j</code>, how the state <code>X</code> shifts has been
    calculated before. Doesn’t dynamic programming algorithm use past results to solve current problems?</p>
  <p>In this way, we will refine the framework code just now:</p>
  <div id="cb8">
    pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title="1"><span >int</span> X <span ># Shadow state</span></a>

    state <code>X</code> get? Let’s look directly at the complete code.</p>

  </div>
  <p>First explain this line of code:</p>
  <div id=0">
    pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a  id=0-1" title="1"><span >// base case</span></a>
  <a  id=0-2" title="2">dp[<span >0</span>][pat.<span >charAt</span>(<span >0</span>)] = <span >1</span>;</a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>This line of code is a base case. Only when the character pat[0] is encountered can the state transition from 0 to
    1. If it encounters other characters, it stays at state 0 (Java initializes the array to 0 by default).</p>
  <p>The shadow state <code>X</code> is first initialized to 0 and then continuously updated as <code>j</code> advances.
    Let’s see <strong>how to update the shadow state <code>X</code></strong> in the end:</p>
  <div id=1">
    pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a  id=1-1" title="1"><span >int</span> X = <span >0</span>;</a>
  <a  id=1-2" title="2"><span >for</span> (<span >int</span> j = <span >1</span>; j &lt; M; j++) {</a>
  <a  id=1-3" title="3">    ...</a>
  <a  id=1-4" title="4">    <span >// Update shadow status</span></a>
  <a  id=1-5" title="5">    <span >// The current state is X, the character pat[j] is encountered,</span></a>
  <a  id=1-6" title="6">    <span >// Which state should pat go to?</span></a>
  <a id=1-7" title="7"> X = dp[X][pat.<span>charAt</span>(j)];</a>
  <a  id=1-8" title="8">}</a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>Updating <code>X</code> is actually very similar to updating the status <code>j</code> in the <code>search</code>
    function:</p>
  <div id=2">
    pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a  id=2-1" title="1"><span >int</span> j = <span >0</span>;</a>
  <a  id=2-2" title="2"><span >for</span> (<span >int</span> i = <span >0</span>; i &lt; N; i++) {</a>
  <a  id=2-3" title="3">    <span >// The current state is j. The character txt[i] is encountered.</span></a>
  <a  id=2-4" title="4">    <span >// Which state should pat go to?</span></a>
  <a id=2-5" title="5"> j = dp[j][txt.<span>charAt</span>(i)];</a>
  <a  id=2-6" title="6">    ...</a>
  <a  id=2-7" title="7">}</a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p><strong>The principle is very delicate</strong>, pay attention to the initial value of the variable in the for loop
    in the code, you can understand this: the latter is matching <code>pat</code> in <code>txt</code>, the former is
    matching <code>pat[1.end]</code>, state <code>X</code> is always one state behind state <code>j</code>, with the
    same longest prefix as <code>j</code>. So I compare <code>X</code> to a shadow state, and it seems a bit
    appropriate.</p>
  <p>In addition, constructing the dp array is based on the base case <code>dp[0][..]</code>. This is why I consider the
    KMP algorithm to be a dynamic programming algorithm.</p>
  <p>Take a look at the complete construction process of the state transition diagram, you can understand the subtlety
    of the role of the state <code>X</code>:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/kmp/dfa.gif" /></p>
  <p>At this point, the core of the KMP algorithm has finally been written. Take a look at the complete code of the KMP
    algorithm:</p>

  <p>After the previous detailed examples, you should understand the meaning of this code. Of course, you can also write
    the KMP algorithm as a function. The core code is the part of the for loop in the two functions. Is there more than
    ten lines in the count?</p>
  <h3 id="v.-conclusion">V. Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The traditional KMP algorithm uses a one-dimensional array <code>next</code> to record prefix information, and this
    article uses a two-dimensional array <code>dp</code> to solve the character matching problem from the perspective of
    state transition, but the space complexity is still O(256M) = O(M).</p>
  <p>In the process of <code>pat</code> matching <code>txt</code>, as long as the two questions of “current state” and
    “what characters are encountered” are clear, it can be determined which state should be transferred (forward or
    back) .</p>
  <p>For a pattern string <code>pat</code>, there are a total of M states, and for ASCII characters, the total will not
    exceed 256. So we construct an array <code>dp[M][256]</code> to include all cases, and make clear the meaning of the
    <code>dp</code> array:
  </p>
  <p><code>dp[j][c] = next</code> means that the current state is <code>j</code>, the character <code>c</code> is
    encountered, and it should move to the state <code>next</code>.</p>
  <p>With its meaning clear, it is easy to write the code for the search function.</p>
  <p>For how to build this <code>dp</code> array, you need a secondary state <code>X</code>, which is always one state
    behind the current state <code>j</code>, with the same prefix as the longest <code>j</code>. We named it “Shadow
    State”.</p>
  <p>When constructing the transition direction of the current state <code>j</code>, only the character
    <code>pat[j]</code> can advance the state (<code>dp[j][pat[j]] = j + 1</code>); for other characters only State
    fallback, you should ask where the shadow state <code>X</code> should fall back
    (<code>dp[j][other] = dp[X][other]</code>, where <code>other</code> is other than <code>pat[j]</code> all other
    characters).
  </p>
  <p>For the shadow state <code>X</code>, we initialize it to 0 and update it as <code>j</code> advances. The update
    method is very similar to the search process to update <code>j</code> (<code>X = dp[X][pat[j]]</code>).</p>
  <p>The KMP algorithm is also a matter of dynamic programming. Our public account article directory has a series of
    articles that specialize in dynamic programming, and all are based on a set of frameworks. It is nothing more than
    describing the logic of the problem, clarifying the meaning of the <code>dp</code> array and defining the base case.
    That’s a shit. I hope this article will give you a deeper understanding of dynamic programming.</p>
