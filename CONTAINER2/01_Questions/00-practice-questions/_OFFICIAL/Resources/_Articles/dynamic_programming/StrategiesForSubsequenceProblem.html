  <h1 id="the-strategies-of-subsequence-problem">The Strategies of Subsequence Problem</h1>
  <p><strong>Translator: <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/sunqiuming526">sunqiuming526</a></strong></p>
  <p>Subsequence Problem is one of the most common algorithm problem, which is not easy to figure out.</p>
  <p>First of all, the subsequence problem itself is more difficult than those for substring and subarray, since the
    former needs to deal with discontinuous sequence, while the latter two are continuous. It is hard enough to simply
    enumerate the subsequences, let alone solve related algorithm problems.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the subsequence problem is likely to involve two strings, such as the “Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)”
    problem in the previous article. Without some processing experience, it is really not easy to figure out. Therefore,
    this article will come up with a routine for the subsequence related problems. In fact, there are only two types of
    strategies. As long as these two problem-solving strategies in your mind, it’s highly possible to ace the problem.
  </p>
  <p>Generally speaking, this kind of question would ask you to find a <strong>longest subsequence </strong>. Since the
    shortest subsequence, on the other hand, is just a character, which is not worth asking. Once it comes to
    subsequences or extreme value problems, it is almost certain that <strong>we need to use dynamic programming
      techniques, and the time complexity is generally O(n^2)</strong>.</p>
  <p>The reason is quite simple. Just think about a string. How many possibilities are there for its subsequence? The
    answer is at least exponential, right? Thus, we have no reason not to use DP.</p>
  <p>Since dynamic programming is used, it is necessary to define the DP array and find the state transition relation.
    The two strategies we mentioned above are actually the ideas of defining DP arrays. Different problems may require
    different DP array definitions to solve.</p>
  <h3 id="two-strategies">1. Two Strategies</h3>
  <p><strong>1.1 The first strategy is using a one-dimensional DP array</strong></p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1"><span>int</span> n = array.<span>length</span>;</a>
            <a title="2"><span>int</span>[] dp = <span>new</span> <span>int</span>[n];</a>
            <a title="3"></a>
            <a title="4"><span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>1</span>; i &lt; n; i++) {</a>
            <a title="5"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> j = <span>0</span>; j &lt; i; j++) {</a>
    <a id=-6" title="6"> dp[i] = max|<span>min</span>(dp[i], dp[j] + ...)</a>
    <a title="7"> }</a>
    <a title="8">}</a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>Take an example we used before – “the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)”. The definition of DP array in this
    case is as below:</p>
  <p><strong>We define <code>dp[i]</code> as the length of the required subsequence (the longest increasing subsequence)
      within the subarray <code>array [0..i]</code></strong>.</p>
  <p>Why does the LIS problem require this strategy? The foregoing is clear enough – because this strategy is in line
    with the induction method, and the state transition relation can be found. We are not going to discuss this in
    details further.</p>
  <p><strong>1.2 The second strategy is using a two-dimensional DP array</strong></p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1"><span>int</span> n = arr.<span>length</span>;</a>
            <a id=-2" title="2"><span>int</span>[][] dp = <span>new</span> dp[n][n];</a>
            <a id=-3" title="3"></a>
            <a id=-4" title="4"><span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; n; i++) {</a>
            <a id=-5" title="5"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> j = <span>0</span>; j &lt; n; j++) {</a>
            <a id=-6" title="6"> <span>if</span> (arr[i] == arr[j]) </a>
            <a id=-7" title="7"> dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] + ...</a>
            <a id=-8" title="8"> <span>else</span></a>
    <a id=-9" title="9"> dp[i][j] = max|<span>min</span>(...)</a>
    <a id=-10" title="10"> }</a>
    <a id=-11" title="11">}</a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>This strategy is used relatively more, especially for the subsequences problems involving two strings / arrays,
    such as the <strong>“Longest Common Subsequence”</strong> we mentioned before. The definition of the DP array in
    this strategy is further divided into two cases: “Only one string is involved” and “Two strings are involved”.</p>
  <p><strong>a) In the case where two strings are involved</strong> (e.g. LCS), the definition of DP array is as
    follows:</p>
  <p><strong>We define <code>dp[i][j]</code> as the length of the required subsequence (longest common subsequence)
      within the subarray <code>arr1[0..i]</code> and the subarray <code>arr2[0..j]</code></strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>b) In the case where only one string is involved</strong> (such as the Longest Palindrome Subsequence (LPS)
    which will be discussed in this article later), the definition of DP array is as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>We define <code>dp[i][j]</code> as the length of the required subsequence (the longest palindrome
      subsequence) within the subarray <code>array [i..j]</code></strong>.</p>
  <p>For the first case, you can refer to these two articles: “Editing distance”, “Common Subsequence”.</p>
  <p>Now let’s talk about the Longest Palindrome Subsequence (LPS) problem to explain how to solve DP in the second case
    in details.</p>
  <h3 id="the-longest-palindrome-subsequence">2. The Longest Palindrome Subsequence</h3>
  <p>We have solve the “Longest Palindrome Substring” problem before. This time, the difficulty is increased by finding
    the length of the Longest Palindrome Subsequence instead of substring:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/subsequence/1.jpg" /></p>
  <p>In this question, <strong>we define <code>dp[i][j]</code> as the length of the longest palindrome subsequence
      within the substring <code>s[i..j]</code></strong>. Please remember this definition so as to understand the
    algorithm.</p>
  <p>Why do we define a two-dimensional DP array like this? We mentioned many times before that <strong>finding state
      transition relation requires inductive thinking. To put it plainly, it is how we derive unknown parts from known
      results</strong>, which makes it easy to generalize and discover the state transition relation.</p>
  <p>Specifically, if we want to find <code>dp[i][j]</code>, suppose you have already got the result of the subproblem
    <code>dp[i+1][j-1]</code> (the length of the longest palindrome subsequence in<code>s[i+1..j-1]</code>), can you
    find a way to calculate the value of<code>dp[i][j]</code>(the length of the longest palindrome subsequence
    in<code>s[i..j]</code>) ?
  </p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/subsequence/1.jpg" /></p>
  <p>The answer is yes! It depends on the characters of <code>s[i]</code> and <code>s[j]</code>:</p>
  <p><strong>If they are equal</strong>, then the longest palindrome subsequence in <code>s[i+1..j-1]</code> would be
    these two characters plus the longest palindrome subsequence in <code>s[i..j]</code>:</p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/subsequence/2.jpg" /></p>
  <p><strong>If they are not equal</strong>, it means that they <strong>cannot appear at the same time</strong> in the
    longest palindrome subsequence of <code>s[i..j]</code>. Therefore, we add them <strong>separately</strong> to
    <code>s[i+1..j-1]</code> to see which substring produces a longer palindrome subsequence:
  </p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/subsequence/3.jpg" /></p>
  <p>The code of the above two cases can be written like this:</p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code
          ><a   title=" 1"><span>if</span> (s[i] == s[j])</a>
    <a title="2"> <span>// These two chars must be in the longest palindrome sequence</span></a>
    <a title="3"> dp[i][j] = dp[i + <span>1</span>][j - <span>1</span>] + <span>2</span>;</a>
    <a id=-4" title="4"><span>else</span></a>
    <a id=-5" title="5"> <span>// Choose the longer palindrome subsequence from s[i+1..j] and s[i..j-1]</span></a>
    <a id=-6" title="6"> dp[i][j] = <span>max</span>(dp[i + <span>1</span>][j], dp[i][j - <span>1</span>]);</a></code>
    </pre>
  </div>
  <p>At this point, the state transition equation is derived. According to the definition of the DP array, what we
    require is <code>dp[0][n-1]</code>, which is the length of the longest palindrome subsequence of the entire
    <code>s</code>.
  </p>
  <h3 id="code-implementation">3. Code Implementation</h3>
  <p>Let’s begin with defining the base case. If there is only one character, the longest palindrome subsequence length
    is 1, which can be represented as <code>dp[i][j] = 1 (i == j)</code>.</p>
  <p>Since <code>i</code>must be less than or equal to <code>j</code>, for those locations where <code>i &gt; j</code>,
    there are no subsequences at all and thus should be initialized to 0.</p>
  <p>In addition, look at the state transition equation we just got. To find <code>dp[i][j]</code>, you need to know
    <code>dp[i+1][j-1]</code>, <code>dp[i+1][j]</code> and<code>dp[i][j -1]</code> these three values. And look at the
    base case we determined, this is how the DP array looks like after being filled:
  </p>
  <p><img src="./pictures/subsequence/4.jpg" /></p>
  <p><strong>In order to guarantee that before each calculation of <code>dp[i][j]</code>, the values in the left, down
      and right direction have been calculated, we can only traverse it diagonally or reversely</strong>:<img
      src="./pictures/subsequence/5.jpg"/></p>
  <p>Here I choose to traverse reversely. The code is as follows:</p>
  <div id=">pre data-role=" codeBlock" data-info="js" class="language-javascript"><code><a   title=" 1"><span>int</span> longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {</a>
    <a id=-2" title="2"> <span>int</span> n = s.size();</a>
    <a id=-3" title="3"> <span>// DP arrays are all initialized to 0</span></a>
    <a id=-4" title="4"> vector&lt;vector&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;&gt; dp(n, vector&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;(n,
      <span>0</span>));</a>
    <a id=-5" title="5"> <span>// base case</span></a>
    <a id=-6" title="6"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; n; i++)</a>
    <a id=-7" title="7"> dp[i][i] = <span>1</span>;</a>
    <a id=-8" title="8"> <span>// Reverse traversal to ensure correct state transition</span></a>
    <a id=-9" title="9"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = n - <span>1</span>; i &gt;= <span>0</span>; i--) {</a>
    <a id=-10" title="10"> <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> j = i + <span>1</span>; j &lt; n; j++) {</a>
    <a id=-11" title="11"> <span>// State transition equation</span></a>
    <a id=-12" title="12"> <span>if</span> (s[i] == s[j])</a>
    <a id=-13" title="13"> dp[i][j] = dp[i + <span>1</span>][j - <span>1</span>] + <span>2</span>;</a>
    <a id=-14" title="14"> <span>else</span></a>
    <a id=-15" title="15"> dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + <span>1</span>][j], dp[i][j - <span>1</span>]);</a>
    <a id=-16" title="16"> }</a>
    <a id=-17" title="17"> }</a>
    <a id=-18" title="18"> <span>// return the length of LPS</span></a>
    <a id=-19" title="19"> <span>return</span> dp[<span>0</span>][n - <span>1</span>];</a>
    <a id=-20" title="20">}</a></code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>So far, the longest palindrome subsequence problem has been solved.</p>
