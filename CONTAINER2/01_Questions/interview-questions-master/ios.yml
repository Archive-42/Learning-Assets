qs:
- q: How much of your product is written in Swift?
  followup: How do you see this changing over the next few years?
  ref: http://sealedabstract.com/rants/objc-is-our-generations-cobol/
  tags: [tech]

- q: What is the oldest version of iOS you support?
  a: Some kind of data-driven decision that sounds plausible e.g. 20% of our users still run iOS 4.  And is it really
    "support" if it's not being tested?
  followup:
    - How do I request a test device running that version?
    - What information do you look at to make this decision?
  tags: [tech]

- q: Tell me about the history of your codebase
  a: Beware the "five years ago we hired an offshore company and we now need somebody to finish it"
  tags: [tech]

- q: What is the process for making a release?
  a: Tests, human QA, beta program (perhaps internal).  Beware the "Process?  What process?"
  tags: [process]

- q: What third-party code do you use inside the app?
  a: In the settings screen.  The real point of this question is that if third-party developers are ignored (to the
    point of a license violation), first party developers will be ignored too.
  followup: How do you comply with the attribution requirements of the code you use?
