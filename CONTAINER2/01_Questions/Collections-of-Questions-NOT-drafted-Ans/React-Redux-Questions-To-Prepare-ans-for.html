<p>1&gt; How to optimize React component to render it less often? (using shouldComponentUpdate to determine if any relevant data changed)</p>
<p>2&gt; What are best practices? (for example why not to use getInitialState, try to find others and know how to explain them)</p>
<p>3&gt; React is rarely used by itself, so expect some questions about data layer, most commonly an implementation of flux:</p>
<p>4&gt; What is flux? How it’s different from the more traditional MVC pattern?</p>
<p>5&gt; How does Redux data flow work? (view, action creator, reducer, view — you should know and explain responsibilities of each; also how state is represented — state tree)</p>
<p>6&gt; Comparison with Angular Js and VUE js?</p>
<p>7&gt; Understanding on state, props, event handling, data sharing, ajax in react, polling, routing</p>
<p>8&gt; Unit testing for React code</p>
<p>9&gt; explain what is higher order component, control uncontrolled component in react.</p>
<p>10&gt; Reducer return a new object or old one?</p>
<p>11&gt; Explain diff between store and flux.</p>
<p>12&gt; What is the difference between Virtual DOM and DOM?</p>
<p>13&gt; Describe synthetic events in React. How it is different from Javascript Events.</p>
<p>14&gt; Explain <code>this.props.children</code></p>
<p>15&gt; Differentiate controlled and uncontrolled components in React Js?</p>
<p>16&gt; How to optimize React component to render it less often? (using shouldComponentUpdate to determine if any relevant data changed)</p>
