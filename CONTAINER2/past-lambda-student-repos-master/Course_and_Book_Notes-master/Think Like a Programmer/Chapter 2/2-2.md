## Diamond Hash

Using only siungle character output statements that output a hash mark, a space, or end of line, write a program that produces the following shape:

```
   ##
  ####
 ######
########
########
 ######
  ####
   ##
```

#### Observations:

Row 1 - 3 spaces, 2 hash marks
Row 2 - 2 spaces, 4 hash marks
Row 3 - 1 space, 6 hash marks
Row 4 - 0 spaces, 8 hash marks
Row 5 - 1 space, 6 hash marks
Row 6 - 2 spaces, 4 hash marks
Row 7 - 3 spaces, 2 hash marks

Hey, wait a second, that formula on the left looks awfully familiar ...

#### Copied over from Half of a Square problem

| 8 - row | 4 - row | abs(4 - row) | 4 - abs(4 - row) |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 7       | 3       | 3            | 1                |
| 6       | 2       | 2            | 2                |
| 5       | 1       | 1            | 3                |
| 4       | 0       | 0            | 4                |
| 3       | -1      | 1            | 3                |
| 2       | -2      | 2            | 2                |
| 1       | -3      | 3            | 1                |

```
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;


int main() {
  for (int row = 1; row <= 7; row++) {
    for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= abs(4 - row); hashNum++) {
        cout << "#";
    }
    cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

That must mean that we can use that for loop to sort out the space situation!
Output:

```
###
##
#

#
##
###
```

Yep! If we change the "#" to " ", that'll have the space settled for sure. Now we just need to figure out how to do the hash marks.

#### Using What We Already Have

```
int main() {
  for (int row = 1; row <= 7; row++) {
    for (int spaceNum = 1; spaceNum <= abs(4 - row); spaceNum++) {
        cout << " ";
    }
    for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= 4 - abs(4-row); hashNum++) {
      cout << "#";
    }
    cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
   #
  ##
 ###
####
 ###
  ##
   #
```

Well, that's half the answer, at least! It would seem that all we would have to do is multiply the `4 - abs(4-row)` expression by 2 to ensure that we had sufficient hash marks ...

```
int main() {
  for (int row = 1; row <= 7; row++) {
    for (int spaceNum = 1; spaceNum <= abs(4 - row); spaceNum++) {
        cout << " ";
    }
    for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= (4 - abs(4-row)) * 2; hashNum++) {
      cout << "#";
    }
    cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
   ##
  ####
 ######
########
 ######
  ####
   ##
```
