## 2.1

Using only single character output statements that output a hash mark, space, or end of line, write a program that produces the following shape:

```
########
 ######
  ####
   ##
```

## 2.2

Using only single character output statements that output a hash mark, space, or end of line, write a program that produces the following shape:

```
   ##
  ####
 ######
########
########
 ######
  ####
   ##
```

## 2.3

Using only single character output statements that output a hash mark, space, or end of line, write a program that produces the following shape:

```
#            #
 ##        ##
  ###    ###
   ########
   ########
  ###    ###
 ##        ##
#            #
```

## 2-4

Design a pattern and see if you can code it.

## 2-5

If you like the Luhn formula, you can try writing a program for a different check-digit system, like the 13-digit ISBN system. The program could take an identification number and verify it or take a number without a check digit and generate the check digit.

## 2-6

If you've learned about binary numbers and how to convert from decimal for binary and the reverse, try writing programs to do those conversions with unlimited length numbers (but you can assume they are small enough to still be stored in an int).

## 2-7

Have you learned about hexadecimal? Try writing a program that lets the user specify an input in binary, decimal, or hexadecimal and output in each of the three.

## 2-8

Want an extra challenge? Generalize the code for the previous exercise to make a program that converts from any number base-16 or less to any other number base. (Ex: Base-9 to Base-4).

## 2-9

Write a program that reads a line of text, counting the number of words, identifying the length of the longest word, and greatest number of vowels in a word and/or any other statistics you can think of.
