If you've learned about binary numbers and how to convert from decimal for binary and the reverse, try writing programs to do those conversions with unlimited length numbers (but you can assume they are small enough to still be stored in an int).

### Breaking Down the Problem

In the Tracking State problem, we used `int number` to store the value of the current digit in numerical form and then for each digit that wasn't the nul terminator, we multiplied by 10 and added the next digit because we were working with base 10. If we're converting a binary number to a decimal number, we're working with base 2 instead. That means that instead of multiplying by 10, we're instead multiplying by 2.

```
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

int main() {
cout << "Enter a number with as many digits as you please: ";
char digitChar = cin.get();
int number = (digitChar - '0');
digitChar = cin.get();
while (digitChar != 10) {
    number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0');
    digitChar = cin.get();
}
  cout << "Number entered: " << number << "\n";
}
```

#### What it's doing: (Given input: 10110)

```
Outside while loop:
First pass:     number = (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 1
                number = 1

Inside while loop:
Second pass:    number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 0
                number = 2 (1 * 2)

Third pass:     number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 1
                number = 5 (2 * 2 + 1)

Fourth pass:    number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 1
                number = 11 (5 * 5 + 1)

Fifth pass:     number = number * 2 + (digitChar - '0')
                digitChar - '0' = 0
                number = 22 (11 * 2 + 0)
```

#### Going the other way, Decimal to Binary

I actually ended up caving and looking for an answer for this one. I got lost in the mire that was attempting to make an array out of the result instead of thinking it through and realizing that I should have kept it as a number and multiplied the index by 10 and used that to multiply the remainder to add to the binary number.

```
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

int main() {
    cout << "Enter a number with as many digits as you please: ";
    char digitChar = cin.get();
    int number = (digitChar - '0');
    int count = 0;
    cout << "Number: " << number << "\n";
    digitChar = cin.get();
    while (digitChar != 10) {
        count++;
        number = number * 10 + (digitChar - '0');
        digitChar = cin.get();
    }
    int remainder, i = 1;
    long long binary = 0;
    while (number!= 0) {
        remainder = number % 2;
        number /= 2;
        binary += remainder * i;
        i*= 10;
    }
    cout << "Number entered: " << binary << "\n";
}
```

#### Let's go through the code to understand what's happening:

Top half where we're interpreting the number and making sure that we have the number in integer form is still the same as we used previously, but we should take a look at the while loop to see what's going on.

Input: 255

```
number = 255; i = 1; remainder;

First pass:     number = 255; remainder = number % 2; number /= 2; binary += remainder * i; i*= 10
                remainder = 1
                number = 127
                binary = 1
                i = 10

Second pass:    number = 127; remainder = 127 % 2; number /= 2; binary += remainder * i; i*= 10
                remainder = 1
                number = 63
                binary = 11
                i = 100

Third pass:     number = 63; remainder = 63 % 2; number /= 2; binary += remainder * i; i*= 10
                remainder = 1
                number = 31
                binary = 111
                i = 1000

Fourth pass:    number = 31; remainder = 31 % 2; number /= 2; binary += remainder * i; i*= 10
                remainder = 1
                number = 15
                binary = 1111
                i = 10000

Fifth pass:     number = 15; remainder = 15 % 2; number /= 2; binary += remainder * i; i*= 10
                remainder = 1
                number = 7
                binary = 11111
                i = 100000

Sixth pass:     number = 7; remainder = 7 % 2; number /= 2; binary += remainder * i; i*= 10
                remainder = 1
                number = 3
                binary = 111111
                i = 1000000

Seventh pass:   number = 3; remainder = 3 % 2; number /= 2; binary += remainder * i; i*= 10
                remainder = 1
                number = 1
                binary = 1111111
                i = 10000000

Eighth pass:    number = 1; remainder = 1 % 2; number /= 2; binary += remainder * i; i*= 10
                remainder = 1
                number = 0
                binary = 11111111
                i = 100000000
```
