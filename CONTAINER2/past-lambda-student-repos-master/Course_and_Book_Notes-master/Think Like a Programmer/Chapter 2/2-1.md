## Upside Down Triangle

Using only single character output statements that output a hash mark, space, or end of line, write a program that produces the following shape:

```
########
 ######
  ####
   ##
```

That fact that it specifies hash mark, space, and end of line leads one to believe that they will need to make use of all three of those output options. So what do we know about the desired pattern?

1. Line one should have 8 hash marks and no spaces
2. Line two should have a space followed by 6 hash marks followed by a space
3. Line three should have two spaces followed by 4 hash marks followed by 2 spaces
4. Line four should have three spaces followed by 2 hash marks followed by three spaces

Truth statements:

1. Space increments from 0 to 4, incrementing by 1 after each row (there may or may not be spaces after the hash marks - difficult to tell.
2. Hash marks decrement from 8 to 2, decrementing by 2 each row

#### First Step: Run old Code to Try to See What Can Be Reused

```
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

int main() {
    for (int row = 1; row <= 5; row++) {
        std::cout << 6 - row << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
5
4
3
2
1
```

Nope, not the function I was thinking of.

```
int main() {
    for (int row = 1; row <= 5; row++) {
        for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= 6 - row; hashNum++) {
            cout << "#";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
#####
####
###
##
#
```

Yes! That's the one I was thinking of. All right, that's similar, but it's not perfectly similar because the number of hashes aren't the same... need to figure out the right maths to make the number of hashes what the problem requires ...

```
int main() {
    for (int row = 1; row <= 5; row++) {
        for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= 8 - row; hashNum++) {
            cout << "#";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
#######
######
#####
####
###
```

Well, that's closer, but it only has 7 at the top and it's decrementing the hash by 1, not 2...

```
int main() {
    for (int row = 1; row <= 4; row++) {
        for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= 9 - row; hashNum++) {
            cout << "#";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
########
#######
######
#####
```

This one doesn't seem like process, but now the top row has the right number of hash marks. Progress is still being made!

```
int main() {
    for (int row = 1; row <= 8; row++) {
        for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= 9 - row; hashNum++) {
            cout << "#";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
########
#######
######
#####
####
###
##
#
```

Okay, so now I know what it looks like when there's 8 rows. You know, given the fact that it's decrementing two at a time, I think it might actually be a good idea to keep that outer for loop at 8. I wonder what happens if I increment row by 2 instead of one each loop ...

Output:

```
########
######
####
##
```

YES! That's most definitely the right amount of hash marks. Now I just need to figure out how to add the spaces to make this work.

```
int main() {
    for (int row = 1; row <= 8; row+= 2) {
      for (int spaceNum = 0; spaceNum <= row / 2; spaceNum++) {
          cout << ' ';
        }
        for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= 9 - row; hashNum++) {
            cout << "#";
        }

        cout << "\n";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
  ########
    ######
      ####
        ##
```

So it looks like it's roughly the right number of spaces, but we need them to be divided between the right and left side... or just halfed...

```
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;

int main() {
  for (int row = 1; row <= 8; row += 2) {
    for (int spaceNum = 1; spaceNum <= row / 2;  spaceNum++) {
      cout << ' ';
    }
    for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= 9 - row; hashNum++) {
        cout << "#";
    }
    cout << "\n";
  }
}
```

Output:

```
########
 ######
  ####
   ##
```
