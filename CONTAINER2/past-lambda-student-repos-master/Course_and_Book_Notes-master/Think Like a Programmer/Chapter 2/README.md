For this chapter, I didn't really take any notes that werne't problem-specific, so notes are contained within their respective problems.

[Luhn_Checksum_Validator](./Luhn_Checksum_Validator.md) are notes on how to write a program that implements or works on a checksum, which is a means of validating a given number such as an ISBN code.

[Tracking_State](./Tracking_State.md) are notes on writing a program that decodes a message.

[Half_of_a_Square](./Half_of_a_Square.md) are notes on how to construct loops to print out a given image using only restrictive print statements.

[Exercises](./Exercises.md) is a list of exercises from Chapter 2

[baseConverter.cpp](./baseConverter.cpp) is a C++ program that takes in a number input as either binary, octal, hexadecimal, or decimal, and outputs it in different bases.

[2-1.md](./2-1.md) are the steps I took in writing a program, ([2-1.cpp](./2-1.cpp)) that would output:

```
########
 ######
  ####
   ##
```

[2-2.md](./2-2.md) are the steps I took to write a program ([2-2.cpp](./2-2.cpp)) that would output:

```
   ##

[2-3.md](./2-3.md) are the steps that I took to write a program ([2-3.cpp](./2-3.cpp)) to output:

```
   ##

[2-4](./2-4.md) are the steps I took to write a program ([2-4.cpp](./2-4.cpp)) to output my own design.

[2-5.md](./2-5.md) are the steps I took to write a program ([2-5.cpp](./2-5.cpp)) that would validate 13-digit ISBN numbers. I also added steps to allow it to validate 10-digit ISBN numbers as well.

[2-6.md](./2-6.md) are the steps that I took to write a program to convert decimals to binary, though I will admit that this document serves no real purpose than to demonstrate my flawed logic during the implementation as it does not do what I hoped it would. This was fixed and improved upon in 2-7.

[2-7.md](./2-7.md) are the steps I took to implement the [baseConverter](./baseConverter.cpp) program

[2-9.md](./2-9.md) are the steps I took to write a program ([2-9.cpp](./2-9.cpp)) that would read a line of text, count the number of words, identify the length of the longest word, and count the largest number of vowels in a word.
