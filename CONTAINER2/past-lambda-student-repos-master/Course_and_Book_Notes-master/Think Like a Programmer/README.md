### Programs so far:

#### Chapter 2:

- [baseConverter.cpp](./Chapter%202/baseConverter.cpp) is a C++ program that takes in a number input as either binary, octal, hexadecimal, or decimal, and outputs it in different bases.

- [2-1.cpp](./Chapter%202/2-1.cpp) is a program that outputs the shape:

  ```
  ########
   ######
    ####
     ##
  ```

- [2-2.cpp](./Chapter%202/2-2.cpp) is a program that outputs the shape:

  ```
     ##
    ####
   ######
  ########
  ########
   ######
    ####
     ##
  ```

- [2-3.cpp](./Chapter%202/2-3.cpp)) is a program that outputs the shape:

  ```
     ##
    ####
   ######
  ########
  ########
   ######
    ####
     ##
  ```

- [2-4.cpp](./Chapter%202/2-4.cpp) is a program that outputs my own design.

- [2-5.cpp](./Chapter%202/2-5.cpp) is a program that validates 10 and 13-digit ISBN numbers.

- [2-9.cpp](./Chapter%202/2-9.cpp) is a program that reads line of text, counts the number of words, identifies the length of the longest word, and finds the largest number of vowels in a word.

#### Chapter 3:

- [3-1.c](./3-1.c) is a C program for sorting an array of student structs.

- [3-1.cpp](./3-1.cpp) is a C++ implementation of the same thing.

- [3-2.c](./3-1.c) is a C program for finding the agent with the highest median sales.

- [3-3.cpp](./3-3.cpp) is a C++ program for determining whether or not an array is sorted.

- [3-4.cpp](./3-4.cpp) is a C++ program that takes in a string and returns a ciphertext.

- [3-5.cpp](./3-5.cpp) is a C++ program that not only creates a ciphertext but also returns the original plaintext

- [3-6.cpp](./3-6.cpp) is a C++ program that creates a ciphertext using a randomly generated cipher array.

- [3-7.cpp](./3-7.cpp) is a C++ program that determines a mode of a given array of integers (though it returns the first mode and ignores others if there is a tie).

- [3-7b.cpp](./3-7b.cpp) is an improvement on 3-7 in that it returns the highest mode, the lowest mode, and the number of modes present in the array (though it still doesn't return all of the modes that exist).

- [3-8.c](./3-8.c) is a C program that determines the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartiles of the student array.

- [3-9.c](./3-9.c) is a C program that is a slight modification on the earlier 3-2.c, allowing the marking of non-working months with a -1 while still calculating the highest sales median.
