### Game Plan

So I've been struggling on this problem for a few days now. On the surface, it seems like a really easy problem to solve. I mean, what is a quartile other than a median of a median? But there seem to be a number of edge conditions that have been causing my implementations to fail or succeed. So now we're going to break it down a bit to try to figure out where the logic gap exists.

### The Problem

Given a _student_ struct that contains an array, return the first, second, and third quartiles for the scores in the student array

[2, 4, 6, 10] -> median would be between 4 and 6, q1 would be between 2 and 4, q3 would be between 6 and 10

#### Scenarios

**Number of values is odd**
Length / 2 would be median

**Number of values is even**
((Length / 2) + ((Length / 2) - 1)) / 2 would be median

### Odd

**[2,5,7,8,9,12,14,18,20]**

- 9/2 = 4
- q1 - average of index 1 and 2
- q2 - index 4
- q3 - average of index 6 and 7
- if (size % 2) > 0, median = 4
- first half 0 < 4
- second half 4+1 < size

**[2,5,7,8,9,12,14]**

- 7/2 = 3
- q1 - index 1
- q2 - index 3
- q3 - index 5

**[2,5,7,8,9]**

- 5/2 = 2
- q1 - average of index 0 and 1
- q2 - index 2
- q3 - average of index 3 and 4

If odd, exclude median

### Evens

**[2,5,7,8,9,12,14,18]**

- 8/2 = 4
- q1 = average of index 1 and 2
- q2 - average of index 3 and 4
- q3 - average of index 4 and 5
- if (size % 2) == 0, median = 4
- first half 0 < 4
- second half 4 < size

**[2,5,7,8,9,12]**

- 6/2 = 3
- q1 - index 1
- q2 - average of index 2 and 3
- q3 - index 4

**[2,5,7,8]**

- 4/2 = 2
- q1 - average of index 0 and 1
- q2 - average of index 1 and 2
- q3 - average of index 2 and 3

If even, include the two elements used to compute median in their respective halves (i.e., if the array is [2,5,7,8], 5 and 7 are used to compute median, firsthalf should include 5, secondhalf should include 7.

### What's Needed:

- [x] Function to compute raw median (always use size / 2, check for odd/even in other functions)
- [x] isEven -> method to check if the length of an array or subarray is even
- ~~[] isOdd -> method to check if size is odd (probably redundant unless returning something more meaningful than just a yes or no~~
- [x] getFirstHalf -> returns array of 0 to median if odd or even
- [x] getSecondHalf -> returns array of median+1 to size if odd, returns array of median to size if even
- [x] computeMedian -> find real median: if odd, studentArray[rawmedian].grade, if even (studentArray[rawmedian - 1].grade + studentArray[rawmedian]) / 2
