## Chapter 1: Strategies for Problem Solving

**Problem solving** - writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated constraints

**Analogy** - an exploitable simularity between a solved problem and an unsolved problem

### Rules for Problem Solving

#### 1. Always have a plan

Your plan may need to be changed or you may have to abandon it and come up with another, but you should never start blindly coding. Planning allows you to set intermediate goals and achieve them.

Without a plan, you only have one goal - solving the entire problem. This leads you to feeling like you haven't accomplished anything until a solution has been reached, which leads to frustration.

If you instead create a plan with a series of minor goals, even if you haven't solved the main problem, you will make measureable progress toward a solution and feel as though you have spent your time usefully.

#### 2. Restate the Problem

This may provide insights into the problem not obvious to you initially. This can be part of your plan for solving the problem, which counts as progress toward your end goal. Restating the problem also allows you to ask clarification from whomever you received the problem from if your assessment of the problem is accurate.

#### 3. Divide the Problem

This can often lower the difficulty of solving a problem by an order of magnitude.

#### 4. Start With What You Know

At every point in your career, there will be some skills you have nailed down, others you can use with effort, and still others that you don't yet possess. Any given problem may be entirely solveable with the skills you already have, or it might not. Either way, you should investigate the problem with the tools already at your disposal before looking elsewhere

#### 5. Reduce the Problem

Example:
You're given a series of coordinates in three-dimensionsal space and need to find the coordinates that are closest to each other. If you don't immediately know how to solve that, you can reduce the problem to seek a solution.

- What if the coordinates were in two-dimensional space instead of three? What if the coordinates were along a line and the coordinates were individual numbers? Then the question becomes find the two numbers with the minimum absolute difference.

- What if instead of having a series of coordinates, you had three? Then you could compare A to B, B to C, and A to C.

Reduction allows us to work on a simpler problem even when we can't find a way to divide the problem into smaller parts. This also allows you to pinpoint what areas of the problem you might be struggling with.

#### 6. Look for Analogies

Don't just look for code similar to the code you need to solve the problem and then try to modify that code to suit your purpose - it's difficult to modify code you don't fully understand. Even more than that, if you don't complete a solution yourself, you won't internalize it, which is a missed analogy for the future.

#### 7. Experiment

This is not the same as guessing. Experimenting is done in a more controlled fashion and involves making hypotheses and then testing whether or not your assumptions about the outcome were correct.

#### 8. Don't Get Frustrated

Realize that you can own your own emotional reaction to things and take a break if you need to.

### Exercises:

1.  Try a medium-difficulty Sudoku puzzle.

2.  Consider a sliding tile puzzle variant where the tiles are covered with a picture instead of numbers. How does this increase the difficulty and why?

3.  Find a strategy for sliding tile puzzles different from mine.

4.  Search for old-fashioned puzzles of the fox, goose, and corn variety and try to solve them. Sam Loyd popularized them, so search his name. Once you uncover (or give up and read) the solution, think of how you could make an easier version of the puzzle. What would you have to change? The constraints or just the wording?

5.  Try to write explicit strategies for traditional pencil and paper games like crosswords or "Jumble"
