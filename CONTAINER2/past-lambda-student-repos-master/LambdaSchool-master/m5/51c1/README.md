# Project Animal Kingdom Search

A student that completes this project shows that they can:
* implement and use interfaces in Java
* implement and use abstract classes in Java
* implement and use Lambda Expressions in Java

# Introduction

Using a combination of interfaces, abstract classes, and lambda expressions, students will create and manipulate a list of animals using object oriented design principles.

# Instruction

* [X] Create an abstract class for animals
    * [X] All animals consume food the same way
    * [X] Each animal is assigned a unique number, a name, and year discovered regardless of classification.

    * [X] Methods will return a string saying how that animal implements the action
    * [X] All animals can move, breath, reproduce. How they do that, so what string should get returned when the method is executed, varies by animal type.
 
* Create classes for mammals, birds, fish
    * [X] Mammals move - walk, breath - lungs, reproduce - live births
    * [X] Birds move - fly, breath - lungs, reproduce - eggs
    * [X] Fish move - swim, breath - gills, reproduce - eggs

Hint: think about abstract classes and creating an arraylist using an abstract class type.

* Create a collection for the animals using the following data
    * [X] Mammals:
        * [X] Name: Panda      Year Named: 1869
        * [X] Name: Zebra      Year Named: 1778
        * [X] Name: Koala      Year Named: 1816
        * [X] Name: Sloth      Year Named: 1804
        * [X] Name: Armadillo  Year Named: 1758
        * [X] Name: Raccoon    Year Named: 1758
        * [X] Name: Bigfoot    Year Named: 2021

    * [X] Birds:
        * [X] Name: Pigeon  Year Named: 1837
        * [X] Name: Peacock Year Named: 1821
        * [X] Name: Toucan  Year Named: 1758
        * [X] Name: Parrot  Year Named: 1824
        * [X] Name: Swan    Year Named: 1758

    * [X] Fish:		
        * [X] Name: Salmon  Year Named: 1758
        * [X] Name: Catfish Year Named: 1817
        * [X] Name: Perch   Year Named: 1758

* Using Lambda Expressions

    * [X] List all the animals in descending order by year named
    * [X] List all the animals alphabetically
    * [X] List all the animals order by how they move
    * [X] List only those animals the breath with lungs
    * [X] List only those animals that breath with lungs and were named in 1758
    * [X] List only those animals that lay eggs and breath with lungs
    * [X] List alphabetically only those animals that were named in 1758
    
* Stretch Goal
    * [X] For the list of animals, list alphabetically those animals that are mammals.
