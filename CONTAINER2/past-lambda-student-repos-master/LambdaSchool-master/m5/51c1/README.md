# Project Animal Kingdom Search

A student that completes this project shows that they can:

- implement and use interfaces in Java
- implement and use abstract classes in Java
- implement and use Lambda Expressions in Java

# Introduction

Using a combination of interfaces, abstract classes, and lambda expressions, students will create and manipulate a list of animals using object oriented design principles.

# Instruction

- [x] Create an abstract class for animals

  - [x] All animals consume food the same way
  - [x] Each animal is assigned a unique number, a name, and year discovered regardless of classification.

  - [x] Methods will return a string saying how that animal implements the action
  - [x] All animals can move, breath, reproduce. How they do that, so what string should get returned when the method is executed, varies by animal type.

- Create classes for mammals, birds, fish
  - [x] Mammals move - walk, breath - lungs, reproduce - live births
  - [x] Birds move - fly, breath - lungs, reproduce - eggs
  - [x] Fish move - swim, breath - gills, reproduce - eggs

Hint: think about abstract classes and creating an arraylist using an abstract class type.

- Create a collection for the animals using the following data

  - [x] Mammals:

    - [x] Name: Panda Year Named: 1869
    - [x] Name: Zebra Year Named: 1778
    - [x] Name: Koala Year Named: 1816
    - [x] Name: Sloth Year Named: 1804
    - [x] Name: Armadillo Year Named: 1758
    - [x] Name: Raccoon Year Named: 1758
    - [x] Name: Bigfoot Year Named: 2021

  - [x] Birds:

    - [x] Name: Pigeon Year Named: 1837
    - [x] Name: Peacock Year Named: 1821
    - [x] Name: Toucan Year Named: 1758
    - [x] Name: Parrot Year Named: 1824
    - [x] Name: Swan Year Named: 1758

  - [x] Fish:
    - [x] Name: Salmon Year Named: 1758
    - [x] Name: Catfish Year Named: 1817
    - [x] Name: Perch Year Named: 1758

- Using Lambda Expressions

  - [x] List all the animals in descending order by year named
  - [x] List all the animals alphabetically
  - [x] List all the animals order by how they move
  - [x] List only those animals the breath with lungs
  - [x] List only those animals that breath with lungs and were named in 1758
  - [x] List only those animals that lay eggs and breath with lungs
  - [x] List alphabetically only those animals that were named in 1758

- Stretch Goal
  - [x] For the list of animals, list alphabetically those animals that are mammals.
