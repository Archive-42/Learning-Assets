# NASA APOD Part II - Advanced Styling Techniques
In this project you will refactor the styling you completed in the APOD app. You will style it using one of the styling libraries you learned in this module.

## Instructions

---

Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected before starting this project.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you and your team lead in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons.


## Project Set Up

---

This homework is a continuation of the work you have done previously.

- [ ] CD into your old project
- [ ] Continue to make changes and push to the same branch


Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge Branch into master (student's Repository).
- [ ] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.
- [ ] Do your magic!

# _Project - NASA APOD (Continued...)_

- [ ] This will be a continuation of the project you've already started.
- [ ] Our goal here is to apply advance styling techniques for your React application.
- [ ] You don't need to start from scratch. Use the work you did previously.
- [ ] Let's say that the designs have changed. There are new ways and implementations of doing things as time goes by. As stated earlier, these are normal in the real world. It's time for us to dig into the code to make it better.


## _MVP Requirements:_

- [ ] Refactor your project using a component library that was covered in class (Reactstrap or styled-components).
- [ ] Implement and use at least a few styled components to beautify your project.


## Stretch Problems

Do not attempt stretch problems until MVP has been reached and a final commit has been made.

- [ ] Read the documentation for MaterialUI to use in place of Reactstrap or Emotion to use in place of styled-components and use either in your app.
- [ ] Try out tailwind css. It's a little tough to get it started in your app, but it's a great library that is gaining popularity very quickly. Here are the [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/), and here is an [article](https://medium.com/@pipecork/using-tailwind-in-react-quickstart-4b06c10317b5) to help you get it started in a React app (written by [Max David](https://medium.com/@pipecork), a Lambda student).
- [ ] Implement snapshot testing in your react application.
