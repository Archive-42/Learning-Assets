i'm not sure how i scored on any of my assignments this week because nobody told me if i met stretch or not.

i did stretch for both assignments this week and the sprint, but i have no idea if i got credit for it or not.  I've had issues with a previous TL where they refused to give me stretch because i didn't pair-program the assignment, which wasn't a stretch or MVP goal on the assignment they graded me on.  The TL in question, who is unfortunately now a TL in my CS cohort, refused to give me a three despite doing several stretch goals, so i had to escalate it to get it changed.  So I want to make sure i'm getting credit for what i did, and if i didn't get stretch on one assignment or another, i'd like to talk about it.  

The way my current TL does the 1:1s is totally fine/cool; I'm absolutely not accusing him of anything untoward; he's been totally fine.  I don't need a constant validation or constant notification of every grade or anything like that.  Nothing needs to change necessarily.  Just our relationship is new and i need to know I'm being graded against the stated rubric and nothing else.
