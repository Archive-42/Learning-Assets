# Quicksort 

For this module, you're going to implement a QuickSort function, which you've done in JavaScript before. Feel free to reference your old JavaScript implementation(s) and simply transpose the code from one language to the other. Typically this is a good way to practice new languages you're trying to learn: by transposing code you've written from one language to another.

Don't forget about the fact that you implemented the `swap` function in the pointers module. Notice at the top of the `quicksort.c` file that `pointers.h` (the header file for the `pointers.c` file) is included, which means you can re-use any of the functions you implemented in that module. You may want to use that `swap` function you implemented in your quicksort implemetation. 

Navigate to the `quicksort.c` file. Implement your quicksort algorithm, then type `make tests` to check if you have all the tests passing.
