# DOM II

Topics:
 * Events
 * The Event Object
 * Event Handlers
  * click
  * mousedown
  * mouseup
  * scroll
  * keydown

## Objectives
 * Manipulate the DOM in response to user events using JavaScript
 * Use event listeners to handle events

## Beginning Project
 * You can open your `index.html` file in your browser to see your work, but you may also work in codepen.io first if you'd like
 * All your work will be done in `index.js`
 * Make sure to read both the `index.html` and `styles.css` files so that you know what you're working with
 * Organization of your code in `index.js` will be up to you. There will be suggestions provided later in the day

## Project Description
 You will have two separate commits for this lab

 rockets:
  * When a block is clicked, it should go to the top of the stack

 travelers:
  * While a mouse is clicked down on a box, it should move to the right
  * When the mouse button is released, it should travel back to its original position
  * A mouse down that occurs during a transition back to the original position should send it traveling to the right agian from its current position

 You will again be using `window.setInterval`. For this method, and any of those listed in the "Topics" section of this README, you are encouraged to use MDN as your resource for Documentation. MDN can be challenging to consume at first, so you may also use something like W3schools if the MDN documentation on a given subject is a bit too complicated.
