# Multi-Table Queries and Database Helpers

## Topics

- Joins
- Database Queries
- Knex Queries
- Modular Code

## Assignment

For this lab you will

- write SQL statements against a pre-populated database using an online tool. Once you have the correct SQL Statement for each query, write it inside the queries.md file under the appropriate heading.
- write the db helper methods for the `schemes` resource in `./schemes/scheme-model.js`

### Multi Table Queries!

Visit [SQL Try Editor at W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/tryit.asp?filename=trysql_select_top) using the **Google Chrome (or Chromium if you use Linux) browser** and write _SQL queries_ for the following requirements:

- Display the ProductName and CategoryName for all products in the database. Shows 76 records.
- Display the OrderID and ShipperName for all orders placed before January 9, 1997. Shows 161 records.
- Display all ProductNames and Quantities placed on order 10251. Sort by ProductName. Shows 3 records.
- Display the OrderID, CustomerName and the employee's LastName for every order. All columns should be labeled clearly. Displays 196 records.

### Database Methods

Write helpers methods in `./schemes/scheme-model.js` that match the following specifications:

- `find()`:
  - Calling find returns a promise that resolves to an array of all schemes in the database.
  - No steps are included.
- `findById(id)`:
  - Expects a scheme `id` as its only parameter.
  - Resolve to a single scheme object.
  - On an invalid `id`, resolves to `null`.
- `findSteps(id)`:
  - Expects a scheme `id`.
  - Resolves to an array of all correctly ordered step for the given scheme: `[ { id: 17, scheme_name: 'Find the Holy Grail', step_number: 1, instructions: 'quest'}, { id: 18, scheme_name: 'Find the Holy Grail', step_number: 2, instructions: '...and quest'}, etc. ]`.
  - This array should include the `scheme_name` _not_ the `scheme_id`.
- `add(scheme)`:
  - Expects a scheme object.
  - Inserts scheme into the database.
  - Resolves to the newly inserted scheme, including `id`.
- `update(changes, id)`:
  - Expects a changes object and an `id`.
  - Updates the scheme with the given id.
  - Resolves to the newly updated scheme object.
- `remove(id)`:
  - Removes the scheme object with the provided id.
  - Resolves to the removed scheme
  - Resolves to `null` on an invalid id.
  - (Hint: Only worry about removing the `scheme`. The database is configured to automatically remove all associated steps.)

#### Schemes Schema

| field       | data type        | metadata                                            |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| id          | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| scheme_name | string           | required, unique                                    |

#### Steps Schema

| field        | data type        | metadata                                            |
| :----------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| scheme_id    | unsigned integer | foreign key referencing scheme.id, required         |
| step_number  | unsigned integer | required                                            |
| instructions | string           | required                                            |

#### API

The following endpoints are available to test the functionality of the model methods.

- `GET /api/schemes/` - gets master list of schemes (without steps)
- `GET /api/schemes/:id` - gets a single scheme
- `GET /api/schemes/:id/steps` - gets all steps for a given scheme, ordered correctly
- `POST /api/schemes` - adds a new scheme
- `PUT /api/schemes:id` - updates a given scheme
- `DELETE /api/schemes/:id` - removes a given scheme and all associated steps

## Stretch Problems

- In [SQL Try Editor at W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/tryit.asp?filename=trysql_select_top):
  - Displays CategoryName and a new column called Count that shows how many products are in each category. Shows 9 records.
  - Display OrderID and a column called ItemCount that shows the total number of products placed on the order. Shows 196 records.
- Add the following method to your API
  - `addStep(step, scheme_id)`: This method expects a step object and a scheme id. It inserts the new step into the database, correctly linking it to the intended scheme.
  - You may use `POST /api/schemes/:id/addStep` to test this method.
