- [ x ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Class components have their lifecycle methods and their own internal state, it's easier(at least for me) to track down which class components has access to which state

- [ x ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Mounting -> Adding to the DOM

Updating -> Editing the data as needed

Unmounting-> Deleting the data

- [ x ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

Clean DRY code that can be reused across several applications

- [ x ] Why is it important to test our apps?

To make sure that our apps are safe and protected, as well as to know that there are no side effects anywhere in the app.
