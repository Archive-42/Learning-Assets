        <p>
          As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size.
          Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can
          imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
          delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart.
          Seeing this has to change a man.

        <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>

        <p>
          Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the
          world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a
          globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an
          equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if
          free men make it.

          <p>
            The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home
            that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely
            round.
          </p>

          <p>
            Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the
            Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out
            the planet Earth.
