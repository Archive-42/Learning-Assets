# Deploying Applications to Azure

Visual Studio Code makes it easy to deploy your applications to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and we've created walkthroughs to help you get started. Whether your workflow is through the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure) or [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service), using a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container, or creating serverless [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/), you'll find the deployment steps you need.

## Deployment tutorials

The tutorials below will walk you through creating a simple website and deploying it to Azure:
