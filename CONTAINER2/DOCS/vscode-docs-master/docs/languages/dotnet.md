# Using .NET Core in Visual Studio Code

[.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/welcome) provides a fast and modular platform for creating server apps that run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Use Visual Studio Code with the C# extension to get a powerful editing experience with [C# IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/visual-csharp-intellisense) (smart code completion) and debugging.

## Prerequisites

Install the following:

- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- The [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) from the VS Code Marketplace.

## Create a "Hello World" app

1. Initialize a C# project:

   * Open a terminal and navigate to the folder in which you'd like to create the app.
   * Enter the following command in the command shell:

   ```console
     dotnet new console
   ```

2. When the project folder is first opened in VS Code:

   * A "Would you like to add the required assets to build and debug your project?" notification appears at the top of the window.
   * Select **Yes**.

3. Run the app by entering the following command in the command shell:

   ```console
    dotnet run
   ```
