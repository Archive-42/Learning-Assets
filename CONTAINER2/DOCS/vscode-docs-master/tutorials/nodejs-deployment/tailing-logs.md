# Viewing Logs

In this step, you will view (or "tail") the logs from the running Website. Any calls to `console.log` in the site will be displayed in your terminal.

Run the following Azure CLI command.

```bash
$ az webapp log tail --name myExpressApp-chrisdias
```

After a few seconds, you should see a message indicating that you are connected to the log-streaming service.

```bash
2017-04-17T19:55:35  Welcome, you are now connected to log-streaming service.
```

Refresh the page a few times in the browser and you'll see log output.

```bash
GET / 304 1.704 ms - -
GET / 304 0.935 ms - -
GET / 304 0.490 ms - -
```
