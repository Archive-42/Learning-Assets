# Publish Changes to your Application

In this step, you will make changes to your application, commit them to the local Git repository, and then redeploy your site by pushing to Azure.

## Edit Your Application

Open the `myExpressApp` folder in Visual Studio Code.

![Open VS Code](images/nodejs-deployment/openvscode.png)

Open `views/index.pug` and change line 5 to say something fun such as 'VS Code Rocks!!' and then save the file (`kb(workbench.action.files.save)`).

> Pro Tip: Turn on "AutoSave" from the **File** > **AutoSave** menu!

## Commit Changes

Open the **Source Control** view (`kb(workbench.view.scm)`), enter a commit message, and press `kbstyle(Ctrl+Enter)` to commit the change (`kbstyle(Cmd+Enter)` on macOS).
