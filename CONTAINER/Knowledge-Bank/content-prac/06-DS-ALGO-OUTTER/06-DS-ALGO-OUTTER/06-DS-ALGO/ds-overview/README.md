# Algorithms-DataStructures-BigONotation

Is simple website I made as a fun project to help me understand better: algorithms, data structures and big O notation. And also to have some practice in: Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Responsive Web Design(RWD). If you discover some errors in the code or typos I haven't noticed please just let me know or feel free to contribute with Github, fork the project and make a pull request :)

Sections are divided into:

  - Big o cheat sheets
  - intro
  - big o notation
  - data structures
  - algorithms
