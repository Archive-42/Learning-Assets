# ---------------------------
# Freedom-patched DeviceTypes
# ---------------------------
#
# In order to make DeviceTypes like CPU, CUDA, etc. directly accessible from
# the caffe2_pb2 module, they are currently freedom-patched into it in
# caffe2/python/__init__.py. This is not ideal: it would be better if these
# were autogenerated when the protobuf definitions were created by using
# allow_alias = true in the DeviceTypeProto definition in caffe2.proto.
#
# However, it is impossible to do this currently without significant effort.
# The issue is that the generated proto constants would conflict with various
# constants defined in the C++ caffe2 codebase (`caffe2_pb2.h`). We cannot
# simply remove these constants and replace them with the caffe2
# DeviceTypeProto constants, because a huge portion of code expects
# at::DeviceType constants defined in `core/DeviceType.h` (apparently
# duplicated to avoid having to figure out how to autogenerate the protobuf
# definitions using cmake for ATen).
#
# Instead, we make a best-effort to add additional definitions in
# `caffe2_pb2.py` by looking for any freedom-patched constants in
# `caffe2/python/__init__.py` and making sure they have corresponding stubs in
# the pyi (see `gen_proto_typestubs_helper.py`).

python3 ./gen_proto_typestubs_helper.py >> caffe2_pb2.pyi
