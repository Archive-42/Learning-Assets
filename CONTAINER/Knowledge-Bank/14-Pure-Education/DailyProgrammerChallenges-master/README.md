## r/DailyProgrammer Challenges

This is just a collection of my recent solutions from [r/dailyprogrammer](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer). Unfortunately, I never really saved the solutions I came up with back when I would do these regularly, but now I'm getting back into the "fun" side of programming. So yeah, this is my collection of solutions from the more recent challenges. Some of them might not be the best or smallest, but they're mine <3
