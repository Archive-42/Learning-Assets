'''
Find the element before which all the elements are smaller than it, and after which all are greater

Given an array, find an element before which all elements are smaller than it, and after which all are greater than it.
Return the index of the element if there is such an element, otherwise, return -1.

Input: [5, 1, 4, 3, 6, 8, 10, 7, 9]
Output: 4

=========================================
Traverse the array starting from left and find all max elements till that element.
Also traverse the array starting from right and find all min elements till that element.
In the end only compare mins and maxs with the curent element.
    Time Complexity:    O(N)
    Space Complexity:   O(N)
