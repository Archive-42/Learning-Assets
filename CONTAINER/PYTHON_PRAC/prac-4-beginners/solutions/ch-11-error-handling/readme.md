## Solution for error handling in tic-tac-toe

The only part of this first pass on the game that could fail is choosing the location.

Did you notice that when it asks for a number, if you don’t enter anything it crashes hard?

How about if you state too much? It asks for row and you answer 2,3 (row and column)? Boom again.

That’s what we fixed here with `try/except`:

    def choose_location(board, symbol):
        try:
            row = int(input("Choose which row: "))

            row -= 1
            if row < 0 or row >= len(board):
                return False

            column = int(input("Choose which column: "))
            column -= 1
            if column < 0 or column >= len(board[0]):
                return False

            cell = board[row][column]
            if cell is not None:
                return False

            board[row][column] = symbol
            return True
        except ValueError as ve:
            print(f"Error: Cannot convert input to a number.")
            return False
        except Exception:
            # Not sure what else happened here, but didn't work.
            return False

For a more advanced version, you could edit the tic-tac-toe from files and make sure we have permissions to save to the files and that they are in a correct format for `json` to read and so on.
