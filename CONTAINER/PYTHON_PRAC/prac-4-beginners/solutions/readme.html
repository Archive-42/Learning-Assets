    <p>
      We’ve decided to include the solutions to the practice exercises.
      Initially, the intention was to omit them. It can be frustrating. However,
      <strong
        >it’s working your way through that actually drives the learning</strong
      >. It feels good to see the solution, but to make it really click, you
      have to make it your own and work your way through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideally, this is a <em>check my solution</em> type of thing. You should
      now see the solutions by chapter above (under construction at the moment.)
    </p>
    <p>Best of luck on the course, Michael!</p>
