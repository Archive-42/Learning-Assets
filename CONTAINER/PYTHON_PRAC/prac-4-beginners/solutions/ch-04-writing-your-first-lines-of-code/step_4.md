## Step 4: Use the built-in library datetime

Use the built-in library datetime and the function `datetime.datetime.now()` to determine the current year and print that to REPL using an f-string.

    >>> import datetime
    >>> right_now = datetime.datetime.now()
    >>> # What is this thing?
    >>> right_now
    datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 10, 14, 41, 33, 790353)
    >>> print(f"What a crazy year {right_now.year} has been, eh?")
    What a crazy year 2020 has been, eh?
    >>>
