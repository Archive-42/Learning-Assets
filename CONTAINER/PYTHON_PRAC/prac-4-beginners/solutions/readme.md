# Solutions: \[Enabled\]

We’ve decided to include the solutions to the practice exercises. Initially, the intention was to omit them. It can be frustrating. However, **it’s working your way through that actually drives the learning**. It feels good to see the solution, but to make it really click, you have to make it your own and work your way through it.

Ideally, this is a _check my solution_ type of thing. You should now see the solutions by chapter above (under construction at the moment.)

Best of luck on the course, Michael!
