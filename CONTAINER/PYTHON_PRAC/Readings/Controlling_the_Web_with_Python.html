      Controlling the Web with Python

    <blockquote>
      <p>An adventure in simple web automation</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Anytime we find ourselves repeating tedious actions on the web with the
      same sequence of steps, this is a great chance to write a program to
      automate the process for us. With selenium and Python, we just need to
      write a script once, and which then we can run it as many times and save
      ourselves from repeating monotonous tasks (and in my case, eliminate the
      chance of submitting an assignment in the wrong place)!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, I’ll walk through the solution I developed to automatically (and
      correctly) submit my assignments. Along the way, we’ll cover the basics of
      using Python and selenium to programmatically control the web. While this
      program does work (I’m using it every day!) it’s pretty custom so you
      won’t be able to copy and paste the code for your application.
      Nonetheless, the general techniques here can be applied to a limitless
      number of situations. (If you want to see the complete code, it’s
      <a
        href="https://gist.github.com/WillKoehrsen/127fb3963b12b4f0b339ff0c8ee14558"
        >available on GitHub</a
      >).
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we can get to the fun part of automating the web, we need to figure
      out the general structure of our solution. Jumping right into programming
      without a plan is a great way to waste many hours in frustration. I want
      to write a program to submit completed course assignments to the correct
      location on Canvas (my university’s
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system"
        >“learning management system”</a
      >). Starting with the basics, I need a way to tell the program the name of
      the assignment to submit and the class. I went with a simple approach and
      created a folder to hold completed assignments with child folders for each
      class. In the child folders, I place the completed document named for the
      particular assignment. The program can figure out the name of the class
      from the folder, and the name of the assignment by the document title.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s an example where the name of the class is EECS491 and the
      assignment is “Assignment 3 — Inference in Larger Graphical Models”.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1382/1*3WzLi_pB4gI999Xzp_tBrQ.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>File structure (left) and Complete Assignment (right)</p>
    <p>
      The first part of the program is a loop to go through the folders to find
      the assignment and class, which we store in a Python tuple:
    </p>
    <p>
      # os for file management<br />
      import os# Build tuple of (class, file) to turn in<br />
      submission_dir = ’completed_assignments’dir_list =
      list(os.listdir(submission_dir))for directory in dir_list:<br />
      file_list = list(os.listdir(os.path.join(submission_dir,<br />
      directory)))<br />
      if len(file_list) != 0:<br />
      file_tup = (directory, file_list[0])
    </p>
    <pre><code>print(file\_tup)</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong
        >(‘EECS491’, ‘Assignment 3 - Inference in Larger Graphical
        Models.txt’)</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      This takes care of file management and the program now knows the program
      and the assignment to turn in. The next step is to use selenium to
      navigate to the correct webpage and upload the assignment.
    </p>
    <h2 id="web-control-with-selenium">Web Control with Selenium</h2>
    <p>
      To get started with selenium, we import the library and create a web
      driver, which is a browser that is controlled by our program. In this
      case, I’ll use Chrome as my browser and send the driver to the Canvas
      website where I submit assignments.
    </p>
    <p>
      import selenium# Using Chrome to access web<br />
      driver = webdriver.Chrome()# Open the website<br />
      driver.get(’<a href="https://canvas.case.edu%27/"
        >https://canvas.case.edu’</a
      >)
    </p>
    <p>
      When we open the Canvas webpage, we are greeted with our first obstacle, a
      login box! To get past this, we will need to fill in an id and a password
      and click the login button.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1294/1*6K21H6TqFp52ilxqhnyJ7g.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine the web driver as a person who has never seen a web page before:
      we need to tell it exactly where to click, what to type, and which buttons
      to press. There are a number of ways to tell our web driver what elements
      to find, all of which use selectors. A
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors"
        >selector</a
      >
      is a unique identifier for an element on a webpage. To find the selector
      for a specific element, say the CWRU ID box above, we need to inspect the
      webpage. In Chrome, this is done by pressing “ctrl + shift + i” or right
      clicking on any element and selecting “Inspect”. This brings up the
      <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">Chrome developer tools</a
      >, an extremely useful application which shows the
      <a
        href="https://www.pathinteractive.com/blog/design-development/rendering-a-webpage-with-google-webmaster-tools/"
        >HTML underlying any webpage</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find a selector for the “CWRU ID” box, I right clicked in the box, hit
      “Inspect” and saw the following in developer tools. The highlighted line
      corresponds to the id box element (this line is called an HTML tag).
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1888/1*smbJ9oczUAAZ5aSCREAvWA.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>HTML in Chrome developer tools for the webpage</p>
    <p>
      This HTML might look overwhelming, but we can ignore the majority of the
      information and focus on the <code>id = "username"</code> and
      <code>name="username"</code> parts. (these are known as attributes of the
      HTML tag).
    </p>
    <p>
      To select the id box with our web driver, we can use either the
      <code>id</code> or <code>name</code> attribute we found in the developer
      tools. Web drivers in selenium have many different methods for selecting
      elements on a webpage and there are often multiple ways to select the
      exact same item:
    </p>
    <p>
      # Select the id box<br />
      id_box = driver.find_element_by_name(‘username’)# Equivalent Outcome!<br />
      id_box = driver.find_element_by_id(‘username’)
    </p>
    <p>
      Our program now has access to the <code>id_box</code> and we can interact
      with it in various ways, such as typing in keys, or clicking (if we have
      selected a button).
    </p>
    <p>
      # Send id information<br />
      id_box.send_keys(‘my_username’)
    </p>
    <p>
      We carry out the same process for the password box and login button,
      selecting each based on what we see in the Chrome developer tools. Then,
      we send information to the elements or click on them as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      # Find password box<br />
      pass_box = driver.find_element_by_name(‘password’)# Send password<br />
      pass_box.send_keys(‘my_password’)# Find login button<br />
      login_button = driver.find_element_by_name(‘submit’)# Click login<br />
      login_button.click()
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we are logged in, we are greeted by this slightly intimidating
      dashboard:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2456/1*jG-_h99LhbiWsJSeMwSGaw.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      We again need to guide the program through the webpage by specifying
      exactly the elements to click on and the information to enter. In this
      case, I tell the program to select courses from the menu on the left, and
      then the class corresponding to the assignment I need to turn in:
    </p>
    <p>
      # Find and click on list of courses<br />
      courses_button =
      driver.find_element_by_id(‘global_nav_courses_link’)courses_button.click()#
      Get the name of the folder<br />
      folder = file_tup[0]
    </p>
    <pre><code># Class to select depends on folder</code></pre>
    <p>
      if folder == ‘EECS491’:<br />
      class_select = driver.find_element_by_link_text(‘Artificial Intelligence:
      Probabilistic Graphical Models (100/10039)’)
    </p>
    <p>
      elif folder == ‘EECS531’:<br />
      class_select = driver.find_element_by_link_text(‘Computer Vision
      (100/10040)’)# Click on the specific class<br />
      class_select.click()
    </p>
    <p>
      The program finds the correct class using the name of the folder we stored
      in the first step. In this case, I use the selection method
      <code>find_element_by_link_text</code> to find the specific class. The
      “link text” for an element is just another selector we can find by
      inspecting the page. :
    </p>
    <p>
      This workflow may seem a little tedious, but remember, we only have to do
      it once when we write our program! After that, we can hit run as many
      times as we want and the program will navigate through all these pages for
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the same ‘inspect page — select element — interact with element’
      process to get through a couple more screens. Finally, we reach the
      assignment submission page:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1496/1*iyz1HiKgExkyWmzW2M5Vxg.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, I could see the finish line, but initially this screen
      perplexed me. I could click on the “Choose File” box pretty easily, but
      how was I supposed to select the actual file I need to upload? The answer
      turns out to be incredibly simple! We locate the
      <code>Choose File</code> box using a selector, and use the
      <code>send_keys</code> method to pass the exact path of the file (called
      <code>file_location</code> in the code below) to the box:
    </p>
    <p>
      # Choose File button<br />
      choose_file =
      driver.find_element_by_name(‘attachments[0][uploaded_data]’)# Complete
      path of the file<br />
      file_location = os.path.join(submission_dir, folder, file_name)# Send the
      file location to the button<br />
      choose_file.send_keys(file_location)
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s it! By sending the exact path of the file to the button, we can
      skip the whole process of navigating through folders to find the right
      file. After sending the location, we are rewarded with the following
      screen showing that our file is uploaded and ready for submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1546/1*RUaMhWWmRg47s10a8Pv6lg.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we select the “Submit Assignment” button, click, and our assignment
      is turned in!
    </p>
    <p>
      # Locate submit button and click<br />
      submit_assignment = driver.find_element_by_id(‘submit_file_button’)<br />
      submit_assignent.click()
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/416/1*dfC4W3awW86kw-KpQH-rOQ.png" />
    </p>
    <h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning Up</h2>
    <p>
      File management is always a critical step and I want to make sure I don’t
      re-submit or lose old assignments. I decided the best solution was to
      store a single file to be submitted in the
      <code>completed_assignments</code> folder at any one time and move files
      to a<code>submitted_assignments</code> folder once they had been turned
      in. The final bit of code uses the os module to move the completed
      assignment by renaming it with the desired location:
    </p>
    <p>
      # Location of files after submission<br />
      submitted_file_location = os.path.join(submitted_dir,
      submitted_file_name)# Rename essentially copies and pastes files<br />
      os.rename(file_location, submitted_file_location)
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the proceeding code gets wrapped up in a single script, which I can
      run from the command line. To limit opportunities for mistakes, I only
      submit one assignment at a time, which isn’t a big deal given that it only
      takes about 5 seconds to run the program!
    </p>
    <p>Here’s what it looks like when I start the program:</p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1618/1*FK2MNOJQgCabZdXAEYT2Gw.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The program provides me with a chance to make sure this is the correct
      assignment before uploading. After the program has completed, I get the
      following output:
    </p>
    <p>While the program is running, I can watch Python go to work for me:</p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*-drw9BuNnPEsDkm5TWRaOA.gif"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The technique of automating the web with Python works great for many
      tasks, both general and in my field of data science. For example, we could
      use selenium to automatically download new data files every day (assuming
      the website doesn’t have an
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"
        >API</a
      >). While it might seem like a lot of work to write the script initially,
      the benefit comes from the fact that we can have the computer repeat this
      sequence as many times as want in exactly the same manner. The program
      will never lose focus and wander off to Twitter. It will faithfully carry
      out the same exact series of steps with perfect consistency (which works
      great until the website changes).
    </p>
    <p>
      I should mention you do want to be careful before you automate critical
      tasks. This example is relatively low-risk as I can always go back and
      re-submit assignments and I usually double-check the program’s handiwork.
      Websites change, and if you don’t change the program in response you might
      end up with a script that does something completely different than what
      you originally intended!
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of paying off, this program saves me about 30 seconds for every
      assignment and took 2 hours to write. So, if I use it to turn in 240
      assignments, then I come out ahead on time! However, the payoff of this
      program is in designing a cool solution to a problem and learning a lot in
      the process. While my time might have been more effectively spent working
      on assignments rather than figuring out how to automatically turn them in,
      I thoroughly enjoyed this challenge. There are few things as satisfying as
      solving problems, and Python turns out to be a pretty good tool for doing
      exactly that.
