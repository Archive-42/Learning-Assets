## [63. Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/description/)

### Problem:

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![robot_maze.png](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

### Solution:

Define `f(i, j)` to be the number of total unique paths from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)`.

```
if (i, j) is obstacle
  f(i, j) = 0
else
  f(0, 0) = 1
  f(i, 0) = f(i-1, 0)
  f(0, j) = f(0, j-1)
  f(i, j) = f(i-1, j) + f(i, j-1)
```

Only two previous states are dependant. Use dynamic array to reduce memory allocation.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} obstacleGrid
 * @return {number}
 */
var uniquePathsWithObstacles = function(obstacleGrid) {
  const n = obstacleGrid.length
  if (n <= 0) { return 0 }
  const m = obstacleGrid[0].length

  const dp = [1-obstacleGrid[0][0]]
  for (let j = 1; j < m; j++) {
    dp[j] = (1 - obstacleGrid[0][j]) * dp[j-1]
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    dp[0] *= (1 - obstacleGrid[i][0])
    for (let j = 1; j < m; j++) {
      dp[j] = (1 - obstacleGrid[i][j]) * (dp[j-1] + dp[j])
    }
  }

  return dp[m-1] || 0
};
```
