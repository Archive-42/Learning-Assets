## [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)

### Problem:

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**

```
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

**Note:**

- If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string `""`.
- If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

### Solution:

Maitain a window in S that would contain all the characters in T. Use a hash table to verify.

Shrink the window to the next matching character when condition is met. Otherwise keep expanding.

Note that there could be too many matching characters within the window, which means the number of matching characters could exceed the len of T. So condition might still be met after shrinking.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {string}
 */
var minWindow = function(s, t) {
  const map = new Map()
  for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
    map.set(t[i], (map.get(t[i]) || 0) + 1)
  }

  let count = 1
  let start = 0
  while (start < s.length && !map.has(s[start])) {
    start++
  }
  if (start === s.length) {
    return ''
  }
  if (t.length === 1) {
    return s[start]
  }
  map.set(s[start], map.get(s[start]) - 1)

  let minStart = start
  let minEnd = s.length

  for (end = start + 1; end < s.length; end++) {
    if (map.has(s[end])) {
      let endCount = map.get(s[end])
      map.set(s[end], --endCount)
      // endCount < 0 means there are too many s[end] within the window.
      if (endCount >= 0) {
        count++
      }

      // There could be too may s[start] within the window.
      // So after dumping the first s[start] the window might still be full.
      while (count === t.length) {
        if (end - start < minEnd - minStart) {
          minStart = start
          minEnd = end
        }

        let startCount = map.get(s[start])
        map.set(s[start], ++startCount)
        if (startCount > 0) {
          // the window is not full anymore
          count--
        }

        start++
        while (!map.has(s[start])) {
          start++
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return minEnd === s.length ? '' : s.slice(minStart, minEnd + 1)
};
```
