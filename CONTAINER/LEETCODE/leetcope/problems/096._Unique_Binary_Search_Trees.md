## [96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/description/)

### Problem:

Given *n*, how many structurally unique **BST's** (binary search trees) that store values 1 ...Â *n*?

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

### Solution:

See [95. Unique Binary Search Trees II](./095.%20Unique%20Binary%20Search%20Trees%20II.md).

When we pick a node `k` in `[1...n]`, the left child of `k` can only exsits in `[1...k-1]`, and the right child in `[k+1...n]`.

Since we are only counting the number of trees. `[k+1...n]` is the same as `[1...n-k]`.

Define `f(i)` to be the number of structurally unique **BST's** that store values `1 ... i`.

```
f(0) = 1
f(1) = 1
f(i) = sum( f(k-1) * f(i-k) ), 1 <= k <= i
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var numTrees = function(n) {
  const dp = [1, 1]
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let k = 1; k <= i; k++) {
      dp[i] = (dp[i] || 0) + dp[k-1] * dp[i-k]
    }
  }
  return dp[n]
};
```
