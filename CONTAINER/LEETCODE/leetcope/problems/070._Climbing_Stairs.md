## [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)

### Problem:

You are climbing a stair case. It takes *n* steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given *n* will be a positive integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Solution:

Fibonacci numbers.

Define `f(n)` to be the total distinct ways to climb a `n`-step stair case.

```
f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1
f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2)
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var climbStairs = function(n) {
  if (n <= 1) { return 1 }

  const dp = [0, 1]
  let i = 1
  while (n--) {
    i = (i + 1) % 2
    dp[i] = dp[0] + dp[1]
  }
  return dp[i]
};
```
