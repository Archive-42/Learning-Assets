## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

### Problem:

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given `"abcabcbb"`, the answer is `"abc"`, which the length is 3.

Given `"bbbbb"`, the answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

Given `"pwwkew"`, the answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.

### Solution:

Keep tracking the rightest qualified substring (`head`).

```
  head           i
   |             |
   ======c=======c······
   |<--length-->|

         head    i ->
          |      | 
   ······c======c======
          |<---length--->
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
  const len = s.length
  if (len <= 1) { return len }
  
  const indices = { [s[0]]: 0 }
  let max = 1
  let head = 0
  let i = 0
  while (++i < len) {
    const last = indices[s[i]]
    if (last >= head) {
      max = Math.max(max, i - head)
      head = last + 1
    }
    indices[s[i]] = i
  }
  
  return Math.max(max, i - head)
};
```
