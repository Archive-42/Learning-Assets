// Inserts an inline indicator noting Firefox version requirements.
// Nothing is displayed if the Firefox version is older than a certain time,
// as defined in the GeckoVersionIndicator macro, which should be used
// instead, as this simply calls through.
//
// Parameters:
//  $0  Firefox version required.
//  $1  default to false; if set make use of a permanent badge
//
// NOTE: This macro has been permanently modified to return an empty string.
//       This is because it eventually called the FirefoxVersionIndicator macro,
//       and that macro didn't display anything if the difference between the
//       version requested and the latest version was greater than 8 versions,
//       which is true for all of the calls made within our documents.
//
// TODO: When we have permanently switched to managing the MDN documents from
//       GitHub, all calls to this macro should be removed from all documents
//       and this macro should be deleted.
