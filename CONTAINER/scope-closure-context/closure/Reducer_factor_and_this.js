//reducer object has one array a and method reduce
//reduce does the job of reducing using reduce method 0.5*(x+y)
//Below is the calculation using reduce method and array [100,200,300]
//x=100, y=200
//0.5*(100 + 200) = 150 -> this will become x in next iteration
//x=150, y=300
//0.5*(150 + 300) = 225 -> expected value -> but we get NaN
