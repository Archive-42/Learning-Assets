# About This Workshop

Progressive Web Apps become superheroes when they can, while still providing a great baseline experience on less modern browsers. They're reliable, fast, engaging, and although they can do many of the things users expect from native apps, they don't take up a lot of space, or require a long install process.

In this workshop, we'll begin with a "classic" single page app, that's a bit bulky in size, has a slow initial load, doesn't work offline, and provides a very "basic" mobile web experience. We'll then enhance it in several ways, so that when key technologies are supported in your users' browsers, their experience ends up being substantially better!

# What will we do?

<img width=150 align="right" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558005/28242665-55010010-69ba-11e7-869a-adb94ae026f9.png' />

First, we’ll add any mobile-specific metadata to the app, and look at how we can use android studio and the iOS simulator to test out our improvements. In order to reduce our page weight a little bit, we'll discuss how to choose between image types like png and jpeg, and some recent advances in compression.

Next, we'll add a service worker, and apply a few caching strategies to ultimately allow our app to work offline! Additionally, we'll take advantage of IndexedDb, so that new data created on a mobile device can be stored as a structured record, available both in our application and service worker scopes.

Then, we'll make use of Web Push and Notifications to engage our users bring them back into the app, and explore encryption and signing techniques that ensure our web clients only get messages that originate from our servers.

Finally, we’ll use Background Sync to further reduce our app’s dependency on a network connection, enabling it to be a free-standing piece of software that synchronizes with the rest of the world when possible.

### By coding along in this workshop, you will…

- Learn how to audit a web application for “Progressive Web Fitness" with Lighthouse, and to measure important performance metrics like "time to first load" and "time to interactive"
- Take a "classic" client-side-rendered single-page app, and make it work offline, without changing a single line of the app's code.
- Get hands-on experience with IndexedDb, a worker-friendly nosql database that's built in to most browsers.
- Build an example of the App-Shell architecture, where large portions of the UI load almost instantly
- Learn what you can do to keep your JavaScript code fast, by taking a look at some aspects of JavaScript engines, and taking advantage of some tools to keep us on the speedy path.
- And much more...

#### Project setup

Finally, while in the top-level folder of this project, download the and install this project's dependencies by running

```
yarn
```

We'll also need some certificates so we can run a development webserver over HTTPS. You can generate them by running

```
yarn prepcerts
```

To start the server, run

```sh
yarn watch
```

(Pro tip: If everything looks like it works, but you can't access the page in your browser, make sure you're using _HTTPS_. Try [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000/).)

# Files and Folders

This is a free-standing client/server Progressive Web App system, including

- A database
- A REST API
- A web client, which starts out as a conventional single-page app, and becomes a progressive web app you progress through the workshop

# How to use it

#### Generate x509 Certificates for serving over HTTPS

`npm run prepcerts`

#### Start the Development Server

To start the development server, run

```sh
npm run watch
```

If you want, you can start the API and UI independently, by running

```sh
npm run watch:api # API only
npm run watch:ui # UI only
```

#### Build Development Assets in the `/dist` folder

This will be an un-minified version of an exercise, and will include some webpack-specific tooling, intended only for development use

`npm run build:dev`

#### Build Production Assets in the `/dist` folder

This will be an an optimized version of the exercise

`npm run build:prod`

#### Run tests

`npm test`

#### Clean old builds

`npm run clean`

# What are the pieces?

- [Webpack 3](https://webpack.js.org)
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) 7.x, setup with the [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/7.0/packages/babel-preset-env) plugins, compiling to ES5 JavaScript
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) for linting JS and JSX
- [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) for traditional management of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) styles
- [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) so compiled styles are external stylesheets instead of inline style blocks
- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) as a component library
- [MUI](https://www.muicss.com/) as a lightweight (6.6K) Material Design inspired UI kit
- [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) as a testing platform
- [SimpleHTTP2Server](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/simplehttp2server) as a HTTP/2 proxy (for development only)
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) - as a lightweight, embedded database (for API)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - as a HTTP server for our API.
